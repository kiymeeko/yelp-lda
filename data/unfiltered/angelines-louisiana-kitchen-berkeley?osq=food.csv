0,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
4,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
5,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
6,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
7,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
8,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
9,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
10,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
11,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
12,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
13,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
14,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
15,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
16,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
17,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
18,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
19,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."

29,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
30,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
31,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
32,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
33,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
34,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
35,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
36,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
37,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
38,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
39,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
40,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
41,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
42,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
43,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
44,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
45,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
46,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
47,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
48,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."

62,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
63,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
64,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
65,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
66,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
67,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
68,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
69,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
70,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
71,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
72,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
73,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
74,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
75,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
76,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
77,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
78,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
79,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
80,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
81,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
82,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
92,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
93,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
94,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
95,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
96,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
97,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
98,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
99,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
100,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
101,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
102,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
103,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
104,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
105,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
106,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
107,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
108,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
109,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
110,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
111,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner.

125,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
126,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
127,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
128,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
129,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
130,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
131,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
132,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
133,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
134,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
135,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
136,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
137,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
138,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
139,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
140,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
141,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
142,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
143,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
144,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.

157,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
158,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
159,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
160,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
161,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
162,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
163,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
164,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
165,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
166,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
167,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
168,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
169,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
170,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
171,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
172,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
173,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
174,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
175,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
176,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.

It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
188,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
189,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
190,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
191,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
192,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
193,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
194,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
195,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
196,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
197,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
198,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
199,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
200,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
201,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
202,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
203,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
204,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
205,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
206,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
207,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
221,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
222,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
223,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
224,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
225,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
226,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
227,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
228,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
229,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
230,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
231,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
232,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
233,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
234,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
235,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
236,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
237,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
238,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
239,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
240,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers.

The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
251,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
252,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
253,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
254,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
255,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
256,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
257,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
258,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
259,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
260,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
261,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
262,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
263,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
264,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
265,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
266,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
267,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
268,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
269,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

283,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
284,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
285,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
286,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
287,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
288,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
289,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
290,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
291,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
292,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
293,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
294,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
295,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
296,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
297,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
298,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
299,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
300,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
301,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
302,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
314,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
315,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
316,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
317,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
318,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
319,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
320,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
321,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
322,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
323,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
324,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
325,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
326,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
327,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
328,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
329,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
330,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
331,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
332,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
333,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home.

334,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
346,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
347,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
348,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
349,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
350,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
351,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
352,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
353,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
354,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
355,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
356,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
357,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
358,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
359,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
360,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
361,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
362,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
363,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
364,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
365,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"

And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
380,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
381,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
382,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
383,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
384,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
385,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
386,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
387,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
388,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
389,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
390,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
391,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
392,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
393,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
394,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
395,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
396,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
397,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
398,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
399,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice.

409,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
410,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
411,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
412,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
413,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
414,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
415,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
416,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
417,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
418,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
419,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
420,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
421,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
422,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
423,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
424,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
425,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
426,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
427,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
428,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."

442,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
443,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
444,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
445,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
446,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
447,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
448,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
449,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
450,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
451,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
452,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
453,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
454,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
455,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
456,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
457,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
458,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
459,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
460,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
461,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
462,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
472,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
473,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
474,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
475,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
476,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
477,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
478,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
479,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
480,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
481,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
482,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
483,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
484,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
485,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
486,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
487,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
488,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
489,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
490,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
491,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner.

505,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
506,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
507,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
508,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
509,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
510,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
511,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
512,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
513,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
514,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
515,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
516,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
517,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
518,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
519,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
520,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
521,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
522,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
523,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
524,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.

537,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
538,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
539,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
540,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
541,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
542,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
543,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
544,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
545,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
546,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
547,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
548,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
549,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
550,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
551,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
552,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
553,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
554,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
555,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
556,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.

It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
568,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
569,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
570,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
571,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
572,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
573,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
574,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
575,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
576,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
577,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
578,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
579,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
580,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
581,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
582,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
583,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
584,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
585,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
586,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
587,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
601,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
602,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
603,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
604,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
605,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
606,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
607,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
608,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
609,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
610,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
611,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
612,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
613,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
614,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
615,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
616,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
617,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
618,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
619,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
620,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers.

The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
631,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
632,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
633,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
634,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
635,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
636,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
637,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
638,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
639,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
640,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
641,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
642,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
643,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
644,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
645,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
646,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
647,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
648,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
649,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

663,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
664,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
665,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
666,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
667,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
668,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
669,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
670,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
671,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
672,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
673,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
674,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
675,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
676,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
677,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
678,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
679,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
680,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
681,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
682,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
694,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
695,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
696,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
697,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
698,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
699,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
700,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
701,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
702,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
703,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
704,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
705,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
706,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
707,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
708,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
709,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
710,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
711,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
712,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
713,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home.

714,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
726,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
727,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
728,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
729,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
730,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
731,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
732,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
733,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
734,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
735,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
736,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
737,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
738,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
739,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
740,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
741,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
742,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
743,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
744,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
745,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"

And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
760,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
761,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
762,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
763,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
764,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
765,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
766,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
767,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
768,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
769,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
770,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
771,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
772,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
773,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
774,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
775,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
776,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
777,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
778,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
779,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice.

789,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
790,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
791,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
792,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
793,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
794,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
795,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
796,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
797,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
798,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
799,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
800,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
801,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
802,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
803,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
804,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
805,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
806,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
807,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
808,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."

822,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
823,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
824,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
825,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
826,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
827,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
828,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
829,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
830,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
831,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
832,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
833,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
834,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
835,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
836,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
837,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
838,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
839,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
840,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
841,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
842,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
852,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
853,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
854,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
855,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
856,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
857,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
858,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
859,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
860,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
861,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
862,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
863,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
864,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
865,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
866,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
867,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
868,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
869,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
870,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
871,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly.

885,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
886,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
887,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
888,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
889,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
890,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
891,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
892,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
893,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
894,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
895,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
896,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
897,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
898,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
899,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
900,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
901,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
902,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
903,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
904,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.

917,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
918,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
919,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
920,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
921,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
922,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
923,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
924,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
925,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
926,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
927,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
928,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
929,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
930,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
931,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
932,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
933,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
934,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
935,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
936,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.

It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
948,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
949,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
950,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
951,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
952,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
953,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
954,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
955,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
956,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
957,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
958,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
959,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
960,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
961,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
962,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
963,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
964,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
965,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
966,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
967,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
981,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
982,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
983,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
984,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
985,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
986,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
987,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
988,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
989,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
990,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
991,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
992,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
993,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
994,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
995,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
996,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
997,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
998,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
999,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1000,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!!

The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1011,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1012,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1013,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1014,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1015,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1016,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1017,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1018,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1019,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1020,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1021,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1022,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1023,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1024,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1025,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1026,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1027,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1028,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1029,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

1034,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

1042,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste.

A good Sweeper could be useful."
1043,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1044,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1045,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1046,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1047,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1048,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1049,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1050,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1051,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1052,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1053,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1054,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1055,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1056,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1057,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1058,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1059,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1060,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1061,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1062,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1074,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1075,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1076,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1077,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1078,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1079,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1080,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1081,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1082,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1083,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1084,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1085,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1086,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1087,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1088,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1089,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1090,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1091,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1092,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."

This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1094,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1106,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1107,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1108,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1109,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1110,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1111,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1112,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1113,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1114,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1115,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1116,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1117,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1118,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1119,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1120,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1121,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1122,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1123,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1124,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1125,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1126,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1139,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1140,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1141,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1142,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1143,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1144,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1145,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1146,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1147,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1148,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1149,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1150,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1151,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1152,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1153,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1154,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1155,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1156,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1157,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1158,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"

The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1169,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1170,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1171,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1172,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1173,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1174,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1175,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1176,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1177,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1178,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1179,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1180,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1181,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1182,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1183,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1184,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1185,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1186,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1187,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1188,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have.

I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1202,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1203,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1204,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1205,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1206,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1207,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1208,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1209,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1210,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1211,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1212,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1213,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1214,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1215,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1216,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1217,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1218,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1219,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1220,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1221,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard.

We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1232,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1233,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1234,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1235,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1236,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1237,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1238,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1239,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1240,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1241,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1242,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1243,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1244,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1245,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1246,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1247,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1248,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1249,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1250,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."

1254,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

1264,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1265,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1266,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1267,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1268,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1269,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1270,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1271,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1272,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1273,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1274,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1275,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1276,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1277,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1278,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1279,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1280,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1281,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1282,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1283,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."

The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1296,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1297,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1298,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1299,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1300,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1301,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1302,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1303,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1304,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1305,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1306,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1307,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1308,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1309,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1310,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1311,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1312,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1313,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1314,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1315,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1328,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1329,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1330,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1331,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1332,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1333,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1334,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1335,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1336,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1337,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1338,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1339,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1340,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1341,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1342,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1343,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1344,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1345,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1346,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1361,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1362,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1363,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1364,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1365,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1366,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1367,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1368,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1369,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1370,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1371,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1372,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1373,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1374,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1375,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1376,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1377,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1378,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1379,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1380,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful!

They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1390,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1391,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1392,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1393,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1394,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1395,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1396,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1397,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1398,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1399,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1400,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1401,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1402,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1403,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1404,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1405,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1406,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1407,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1408,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1409,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good.

1414,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

1422,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1423,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1424,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1425,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1426,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1427,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1428,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1429,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1430,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1431,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1432,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1433,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1434,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1435,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1436,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1437,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1438,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1439,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1440,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1441,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1442,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1452,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1453,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1454,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1455,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1456,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1457,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1458,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1459,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1460,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1461,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1462,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1463,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1464,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1465,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1466,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1467,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1468,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1469,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1470,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."

1474,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1485,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1486,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1487,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1488,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1489,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1490,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1491,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1492,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1493,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1494,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1495,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1496,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1497,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1498,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1499,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1500,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1501,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1502,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1503,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1504,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything...

A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1516,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1517,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1518,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1519,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1520,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1521,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1522,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1523,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1524,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1525,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1526,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1527,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1528,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1529,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1530,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1531,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1532,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1533,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1534,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1535,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out.

We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1548,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1549,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1550,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1551,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1552,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1553,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1554,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1555,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1556,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1557,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1558,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1559,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1560,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1561,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1562,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1563,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1564,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1565,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1566,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1567,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom.

The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1581,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1582,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1583,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1584,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1585,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1586,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1587,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1588,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1589,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1590,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1591,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1592,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1593,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1594,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1595,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1596,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1597,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1598,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1599,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1600,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"

1610,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1611,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1612,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1613,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1614,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1615,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1616,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1617,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1618,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1619,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1620,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1621,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1622,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1623,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1624,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1625,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1626,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1627,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1628,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1629,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

1634,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

1642,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1643,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1644,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1645,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1646,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1647,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1648,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1649,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1650,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1651,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1652,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1653,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1654,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1655,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1656,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1657,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1658,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1659,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1660,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1661,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1662,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

1673,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1674,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1675,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1676,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1677,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1678,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1679,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1680,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1681,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1682,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1683,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1684,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1685,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1686,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1687,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1688,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1689,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1690,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1691,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1692,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."

This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1694,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1706,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1707,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1708,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1709,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1710,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1711,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1712,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1713,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1714,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1715,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1716,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1717,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1718,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1719,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1720,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1721,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1722,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1723,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1724,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1725,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"

My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1739,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1740,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1741,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1742,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1743,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1744,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1745,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1746,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1747,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1748,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1749,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1750,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1751,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1752,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1753,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1754,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1755,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1756,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1757,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1758,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash.

Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1769,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1770,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1771,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1772,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1773,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1774,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1775,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1776,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1777,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1778,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1779,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1780,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1781,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1782,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1783,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1784,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1785,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1786,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1787,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1802,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1803,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1804,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1805,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1806,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1807,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1808,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1809,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1810,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1811,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1812,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1813,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1814,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1815,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1816,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1817,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1818,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1819,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1820,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1821,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3...

For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1831,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1832,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1833,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1834,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1835,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1836,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1837,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1838,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1839,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1840,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1841,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1842,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1843,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1844,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1845,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1846,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1847,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1848,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1849,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1850,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception.

1854,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1855,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1864,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1865,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1866,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1867,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1868,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1869,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1870,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1871,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1872,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1873,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1874,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1875,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1876,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1877,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1878,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1879,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1880,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1881,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1882,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF.

The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1894,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1895,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1896,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1897,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1898,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1899,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1900,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1901,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1902,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1903,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1904,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1905,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1906,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1907,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1908,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1909,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1910,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1911,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1912,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1913,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1914,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1915,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1926,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1927,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1928,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1929,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1930,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1931,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1932,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1933,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1934,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1935,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1936,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1937,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1938,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1939,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1940,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1941,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1942,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1943,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1944,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1945,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1946,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

1954,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
1960,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
1961,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
1962,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
1963,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
1964,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
1965,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
1966,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
1967,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
1968,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
1969,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1970,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1971,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1972,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1973,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1974,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1975,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1976,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1977,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1978,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1979,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great.

1989,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
1990,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
1991,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1992,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
1993,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
1994,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
1995,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
1996,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
1997,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
1998,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
1999,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2000,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2001,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2002,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2003,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2004,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2005,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2006,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2007,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2008,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2009,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good.

2014,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2015,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

2022,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2023,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2024,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2025,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2026,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2027,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2028,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2029,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2030,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2031,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2032,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2033,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2034,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2035,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2036,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2037,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2038,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2039,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2040,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2041,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2042,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2052,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2053,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2054,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2055,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2056,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2057,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2058,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2059,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2060,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2061,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2062,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2063,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2064,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2065,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2066,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2067,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2068,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2069,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2070,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."

2074,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2085,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2086,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2087,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2088,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2089,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2090,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2091,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2092,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2093,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2094,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2095,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2096,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2097,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2098,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2099,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2100,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2101,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2102,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2103,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2104,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything...

A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2116,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2117,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2118,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2119,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2120,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2121,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2122,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2123,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2124,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2125,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2126,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2127,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2128,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2129,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2130,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2131,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2132,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2133,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2134,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2135,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out.

We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2148,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2149,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2150,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2151,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2152,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2153,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2154,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2155,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2156,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2157,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2158,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2159,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2160,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2161,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2162,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2163,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2164,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2165,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2166,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2167,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom.

The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2181,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2182,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2183,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2184,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2185,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2186,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2187,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2188,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2189,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2190,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2191,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2192,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2193,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2194,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2195,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2196,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2197,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2198,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2199,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2200,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"

2210,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2211,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2212,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2213,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2214,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2215,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2216,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2217,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2218,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2219,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2220,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2221,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2222,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2223,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2224,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2225,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2226,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2227,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2228,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2229,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

2234,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2235,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

2242,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2243,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2244,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2245,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2246,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2247,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2248,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2249,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2250,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2251,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2252,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2253,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2254,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2255,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2256,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2257,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2258,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2259,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2260,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2261,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2262,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF.

2273,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2274,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2275,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2276,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2277,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2278,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2279,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2280,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2281,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2282,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2283,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2284,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2285,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2286,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2287,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2288,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2289,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2290,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2291,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2292,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."

2294,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2306,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2307,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2308,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2309,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2310,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2311,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2312,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2313,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2314,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2315,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2316,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2317,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2318,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2319,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2320,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2321,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2322,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2323,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2324,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2325,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2326,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2339,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2340,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2341,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2342,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2343,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2344,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2345,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2346,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2347,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2348,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2349,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2350,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2351,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2352,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2353,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2354,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2355,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2356,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2357,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2358,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash.

Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2369,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2370,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2371,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2372,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2373,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2374,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2375,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2376,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2377,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2378,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2379,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2380,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2381,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2382,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2383,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2384,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2385,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2386,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2387,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2402,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2403,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2404,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2405,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2406,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2407,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2408,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2409,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2410,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2411,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2412,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2413,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2414,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2415,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2416,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2417,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2418,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2419,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2420,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2421,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3...

For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2431,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2432,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2433,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2434,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2435,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2436,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2437,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2438,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2439,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2440,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2441,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2442,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2443,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2444,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2445,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2446,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2447,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2448,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2449,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2450,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception.

2454,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2464,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2465,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2466,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2467,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2468,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2469,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2470,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2471,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2472,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2473,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2474,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2475,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2476,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2477,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2478,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2479,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2480,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2481,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2482,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF.

The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2494,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2495,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2496,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2497,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2498,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2499,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2500,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2501,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2502,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2503,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2504,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2505,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2506,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2507,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2508,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2509,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2510,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2511,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2512,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2513,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2514,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2515,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2526,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2527,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2528,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2529,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2530,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2531,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2532,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2533,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2534,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2535,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2536,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2537,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2538,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2539,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2540,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2541,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2542,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2543,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2544,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2545,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2546,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2560,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2561,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2562,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2563,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2564,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2565,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2566,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2567,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2568,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2569,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2570,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2571,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2572,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2573,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2574,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2575,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2576,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2577,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2578,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2579,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great.

2589,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2590,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2591,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2592,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2593,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2594,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2595,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2596,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2597,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2598,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2599,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2600,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2601,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2602,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2603,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2604,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2605,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2606,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2607,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2608,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."

Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2623,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2624,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2625,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2626,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2627,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2628,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2629,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2630,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2631,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2632,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2633,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2634,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2635,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2636,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2637,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2638,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2639,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2640,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2641,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2642,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2652,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2653,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2654,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2655,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2656,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2657,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2658,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2659,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2660,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2661,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2662,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2663,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2664,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2665,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2666,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2667,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2668,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2669,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2670,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."

2674,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2685,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2686,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2687,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2688,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2689,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2690,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2691,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2692,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2693,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2694,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2695,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2696,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2697,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2698,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2699,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2700,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2701,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2702,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2703,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2704,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything...

A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2716,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2717,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2718,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2719,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2720,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2721,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2722,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2723,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2724,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2725,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2726,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2727,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2728,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2729,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2730,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2731,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2732,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2733,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2734,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2735,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out.

We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2748,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2749,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2750,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2751,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2752,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2753,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2754,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2755,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2756,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2757,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2758,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2759,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2760,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2761,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2762,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2763,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2764,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2765,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2766,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2767,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom.

The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2781,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2782,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2783,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2784,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2785,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2786,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2787,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2788,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2789,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2790,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2791,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2792,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2793,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2794,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2795,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2796,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2797,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2798,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2799,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2800,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"

2810,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2811,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2812,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2813,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2814,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2815,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2816,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2817,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2818,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2819,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2820,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2821,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2822,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2823,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2824,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2825,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2826,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2827,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2828,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2829,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

2834,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2835,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

2842,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2843,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2844,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2845,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2846,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2847,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2848,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2849,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2850,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2851,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2852,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2853,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2854,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2855,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2856,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2857,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2858,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2859,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2860,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2861,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2862,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

2873,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2874,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2875,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2876,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2877,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2878,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2879,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2880,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2881,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2882,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2883,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2884,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2885,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2886,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2887,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2888,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2889,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2890,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2891,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2892,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."

This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2894,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2906,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2907,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2908,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2909,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2910,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2911,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2912,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2913,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2914,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2915,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2916,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2917,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2918,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2919,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2920,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2921,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2922,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2923,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2924,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2925,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2926,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2939,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2940,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2941,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2942,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2943,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2944,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2945,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2946,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2947,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
2948,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2949,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2950,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2951,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2952,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2953,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2954,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2955,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2956,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2957,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2958,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash.

Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
2969,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
2970,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
2971,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
2972,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
2973,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
2974,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
2975,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
2976,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
2977,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
2978,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
2979,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
2980,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
2981,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
2982,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2983,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
2984,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
2985,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
2986,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
2987,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."

I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3002,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3003,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3004,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3005,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3006,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3007,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3008,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3009,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3010,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3011,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3012,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3013,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3014,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3015,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3016,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3017,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3018,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3019,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3020,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3021,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3...

For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3031,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3032,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3033,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3034,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3035,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3036,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3037,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3038,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3039,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3040,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3041,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3042,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3043,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3044,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3045,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3046,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3047,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3048,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3049,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3050,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception.

3054,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3064,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3065,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3066,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3067,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3068,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3069,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3070,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3071,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3072,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3073,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3074,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3075,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3076,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3077,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3078,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3079,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3080,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3081,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3082,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF.

The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3094,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3095,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3096,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3097,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3098,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3099,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3100,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3101,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3102,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3103,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3104,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3105,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3106,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3107,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3108,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3109,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3110,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3111,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3112,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3113,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3114,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3115,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3126,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3127,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3128,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3129,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3130,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3131,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3132,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3133,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3134,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3135,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3136,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3137,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3138,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3139,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3140,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3141,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3142,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3143,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3144,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3145,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3146,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."

And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3160,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3161,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3162,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3163,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3164,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3165,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3166,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3167,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3168,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3169,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3170,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3171,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3172,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3173,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3174,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3175,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3176,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3177,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3178,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3179,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great.

3189,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3190,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3191,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3192,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3193,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3194,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3195,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3196,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3197,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3198,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3199,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3200,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3201,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3202,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3203,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3204,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3205,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3206,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3207,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3208,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."

Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3223,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3224,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3225,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3226,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3227,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3228,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3229,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3230,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3231,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3232,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3233,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3234,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3235,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3236,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3237,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3238,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3239,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3240,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3241,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3242,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3252,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3253,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3254,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3255,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3256,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3257,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3258,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3259,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3260,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3261,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3262,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3263,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3264,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3265,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3266,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3267,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3268,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3269,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3270,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."

I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3285,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3286,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3287,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3288,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3289,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3290,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3291,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3292,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3293,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3294,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3295,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3296,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3297,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3298,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3299,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3300,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3301,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3302,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3303,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3304,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything...

A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3316,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3317,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3318,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3319,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3320,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3321,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3322,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3323,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3324,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3325,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3326,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3327,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3328,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3329,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3330,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3331,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3332,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3333,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3334,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3335,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay.

We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3348,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3349,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3350,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3351,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3352,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3353,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3354,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3355,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3356,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3357,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3358,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3359,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3360,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3361,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3362,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3363,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3364,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3365,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3366,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3367,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable.

The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3381,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3382,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3383,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3384,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3385,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3386,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3387,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3388,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3389,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3390,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3391,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3392,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3393,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3394,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3395,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3396,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3397,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3398,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3399,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3400,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side!

For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers.

3410,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3411,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3412,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3413,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3414,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3415,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3416,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3417,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3418,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3419,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3420,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3421,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3422,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3423,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3424,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3425,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3426,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3427,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3428,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3429,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.

3434,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

3442,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super.

Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3443,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3444,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3445,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3446,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3447,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3448,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3449,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3450,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3451,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3452,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3453,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3454,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3455,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3456,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3457,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3458,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3459,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3460,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3461,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3462,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."

3473,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3474,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3475,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3476,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3477,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3478,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3479,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
3480,"As a Cajun food lover, I have not been able to perfect many of their dishes but if you are craving Cajun/Creole food, you have to try and make it out here to this restaurant! I love spicy food that gets you a ...little heated! This place will be so worth your visit!This place is located on the busy street of Shattuck in Berkeley. There is plenty of parking spaces to pay but may not be vacant. Best to come here early for lunch or dinner. Watch out for the homeless as there were a lot in front of this place.If you have a large group, I recommend to make a reservation since they make exemptions for large groups but an automatic 18% will be added to you bill.'Bless' was our waitress and she was awesome and beautiful! Yes, that's her name! Beautiful and unique name, too. Very helpful on recommendations. I personally chose Crawfish Étouffée for me as I hate deshelling crawfish and this plate, there is no taking off the shell for you. Very good and generous portions! Actually, all dishes were generous portions. Another good dish is their Buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken breast was not dry at all but moist and seasoned well. The sweet potato smash and sweet peas were a perfect combo with it. Don't forget to get their baked Mac n cheese as their side! Very very good and I should have ordered one for to-go as it's a meal in itself!! My nephew ordered gumbo and father-in-law ordered their Mixed Grill plate. I didn't get to try it but it was about gone by the time I wanted to try so you know it's good! I also had their sparkling strawberry lemonade which was good especially, it's free refills!! For dessert, yes, I totally totally recommend their order of beignets! I have tried many ...and I have to say, theirs is one of the best!!I will be one of their regular customers. The prices are a bit high but for what you get, it's worth it in my book! [83/100]"
3481,"I'm a fan of the shrimp creole -- squeeze the lemon all over that shrimp + tomato sauce and we're in business. Zesty is right! There are lots of unique, Cajun-style flavors in the sauce, and the shrimp is cooked pretty well. I'd love to figure out the spices in this dish because I haven't tasted anything quite like it. A+ for Angeline's here. As for the hush puppies -- can't give 'em more than a 3... I haven't had hush puppies before and couldn't tell why they were so special, but apparently the ones here at Angeline's are only just-okay. I was told this by someone who is more of an expert than I am with Southern food.Angeline's is a great place for groups. However, it did get a bit loud so I had to shout a little to be heard. I'm coming back here though when I'd like to treat myself to another comfortable, hearty meal."
3482,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
3483,"AMBIANCE: Walking in here you will get a true down south feel right from the decor to the warm welcoming hospitality. Our waitress was stellar. She checked on us just enough and I could tell she enjoyed working here. FOOD: The hubby and I started off with fried oysters which were tasty and huge!! I got the gumbo which was very lack luster. Tasted like a box mix was used to make this. We then ordered our entrees...I opted for the crawfish etoufee, one of my many favorite southern dishes. It was made well but nothing to write home about. Just good. He ordered the fried catfish which came with hush puppies. The catfish was also fresh and nicely fried with a crunchy exterior but nothing that made me say ""wow""! The hush puppies on the other hand were my favorite thing here. They came with a honey butter to dip in... so good! So good that we ordered a box to go! The baked Mac and cheese was a failed attempt at what possibly could have been a true southern style Mac and cheese but there was excessive butter used and therefore I almost choked when I took bite and tasted nothing but melted butter. Overall, we had a nice lunch here but I had much higher expectations after all the Yelp reviews. P.S Angeline's will not do you justice if you've ever been to Brenda's in SF. I think we were wanting something more in every bite that we just couldn't find here. Womp womp..."
3484,Came here for dinner the other day while in town for the week.I was craving fried chicken and decided to make my way here on the way to the airport.I got there around 630pm and got sat right away at the counter with my two other friends.Food came out in a decent time and although I did eat everything... I would maybe come back again and if I did I would like to try something else off the menu. Lemonade hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken was okay.I don't know what parking is like but I'm thinking it's a hassle. I caught an uber here.
3485,"Initially got seated with my one friend at a two seater and we put in our orders before realizing that another person would actually be joining us and the waiters were understanding and very kind and moved us to a table that sat all 3 of us comfortably even with the longer wait time that was there at the time. Before getting to the actual food I have to rave about their root beer. I know it seems inconsequential like, ya root beer, a drink, wow, but seriously...THIS WAS THE BEST ROOT BEER, SCRATCH THAT, BEST DRINK EVER!!! The Abita Cane Sugar Root beer stays true to the Louisiana flow and is just...whew amazing. (I'm legit about to order a case online now)For starters we got the hush puppies (our initial reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with) and I can say with confidence that they did not disappoint. I personally loved the simply flavors and how well they melded with the honey butter. Really a must try. Now to the food, I had the fried chicken entree that came with sweet potatoe mash and green beans. Since I don't eat pork I couldn't have the ham gravy and as they don't have any other sort of gravy I had my dish gravy-less but all the same, it was well done and made me do a happy dance in my seat. And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3486,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3487,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3488,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3489,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3490,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3491,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3492,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."

3494,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.

And now the mac & cheese side, wow, like really, wow. It was a perfect balance of cheesy, oily (in a good way), and just plain excellence. We finished the bowl to the last piece of pasta. And to end the meal with a shabang we of course had to get the beignets, but really they should be called beign-YAY-s because DAAMMMNNN THEY WERE AMAZING. Legit took my first bite and I FELT the fluffy freshness of sexy goodness in my mouth. I melted. I died. Then I came back to life and ate 2 whole beignets myself because...well they were heaven and heaven is worth the calories. The service honestly couldn't have been better with every person who we came in contact with being super nice and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. This place is a must go SO DON'T PASS IT UP!!!"
3506,"We came here on July 4th.  It wasn't busy at the time and we were seated right away.  We ordered the ribs, jambalaya, mac n cheese and one glass of wine.  The mac n cheese was awesome and perfectly baked.  The jambalaya was one of the better jambalayas I've had and the portions are so big that they have to serve it in a Pho bowl (check out my pics).  The ribs had good smoky sauce, but were a little tough.  I'd order them again on a busier night when I know that they would probably be fresher.The prices were very reasonable.  I'd love to come back for the huge po boys.  The table next to me ordered it and the guy only could finish half."
3507,"Angeline's is a darkly lit southern restaurant. I've been here on multiple occasions, for birthdays, graduations, and just regular dinner, and have liked it less than I hoped. The wait is usually long for dinner time, which is understandable. However, the last time we were here, we had a group of 5 that was wedged in a cramped table next to the hall leading to the bathroom. We're all relatively small people but it still felt a little tight, especially when all of our large dishes were on the table. As for the food, I always want to like it more than I actually do, especially hearing so much hype about the food. +CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE: This one is my current go-to dish here but doesn't quite blow your mind away, though I like all the little crawfish that are actually in there. The green beans also add a nice crunchiness that the dish needs.-FRIED CATFISH: This whole plate is a little too much fried food for me, though the catfish itself is pretty good. It's just when you add the hush puppies does it get very dense and dry.-FRIED CHICKEN: It's pretty decent with the portion size, and many of our group usually get this dish, but again, nothing that blew me away.Ultimately, the food here is pretty heavy and the portions are quite large. Though the price is steeper, I think you get what you pay for when it comes to amount. The staff are nice and it's a pretty decent celebratory locale."
3508,"Angeline's is well located in downtown Berkeley, with 2 hour parking spots right outside. They've got a decent sized dining space, though it never hurts to make a reservation by calling direct or using Open Table, which they are listed on. Food: Hush puppies were a good size, with a good brown crust on the outside, and a soft fluffy inside, served with a whipped honey butter. Fried chicken came with green beans, mashed sweet potato, and gravy. Their fried chicken are thin fillets of boneless chicken breasts. The batter was crunchy, and mash had good flavor. Downside, the food arrived at room temp, so the gravy had crusted over, and the chicken didn't taste as good as it could have. The Voodoo shrimp was barbecued shrimp in a gravy over rice and green beans on the side. The shrimp was slightly over cooked, and a little tough. Otherwise, the seasoning was tasty, along with the gravy. Again, this came out at room temp. Service: Mostly attentive. We arrived at lunch time, 12:30pm. Drinks were refilled rather quickly. The only downside was that the entrees sat on the bar/food warming area for quite some time before it was delivered to our table. Cost: One appetizer, two entrees, and two sweet teas came out to $53.43 before tip. Overall: We may be back to give it another try based on other reviews."
3509,It was pretty good.  Went sat afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away.  We had the jambalaya and the fried chicken po boy.  I'll start with the po boy.  It was huge!  Could easily be split between two people.  It was pretty good.  Generous amount of chicken too.  The potatoe salad that it came with left a lot to be desired though.  Cut up plain boiled red potatoes with a pinkish colored mayonnaise on it and nothing else.  Surely they can do better than that.  I don't think they serve fries at all.  Don't they serve fries in Louisiana too?  My husband had the jambalaya.  He loved it.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  You couldn't really make out any chicken or ham but there was sausage.  Perhaps it was cut really fine.I was really tempted to steal a hush puppy off the guy next to us cause they looked so good. The service was wonderful and the place is comfortable. They were playing good music.  I noticed a few people started swaying to the music and my husband started a slight dance in his seat which is EXTREMELY rare.The prices are on the steep side but their portions are generous.  There is a smallish parking garage around the block to park.The waiter said their fried chicken was the most popular item on the menu.
3510,"Yummy!I love this spot and the food is pretty amazing.  The interior brick walls and cozy interior of this spot is reflective of a the stereotypical Southern hospitality.  The only thing that lacked on this day was that it took forever for someone to come and even take our initial water order, which was strange since they kept on serving the other two flanking tables with no problem.  We finally had to go get someone to help us, which is not very welcoming.Despite starting off on the wrong foot, the rest of our meal and service (positive) made up for the lack of the warm reception. The menu here is specific and not a of gray areas to distract.  Started off with hush puppies, which I found was just more starch to waste the space, but if you have never had them, order them.  They were big puffs of crunchy carb balls with flecks of seasoning.  For the main entree, I opted for the ribs and the bf ordered the fried chicken.  While the fried chicken was typical, I was impressed with the ribs.  They fell off the bones just as a decent and well slow cooked method should warrant.  Juicy and the sauce was a good balance between tangy and sweet. For dessert, we ordered the beignets, lord knows why.  The amount of sugar and carbs in that dish is enough to cause diabetes in anyone, including a piece of rock.  While I cannot say that I have had beignets elsewhere that would challenge the authenticity but when in Rome...Great food, great location, lukewarm reception but hoping we just visited on a down day."
3511,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
3512,"I should have started my yelp review about this place the first time I had Angeline's. I would have given them 5 stars. Each time I dined at this place I would always have a food coma. Their food was incredible until they expanded the small restaurant and made it a larger one. Their food since then, was never the same. My sister, who loves food just as much as I do, couldn't agree more. A little disappointed to be honest. Sorry Angeline's! #TastebudsDontLie Plating is still the same though."
3513,"My husband is from New Orleans and we go there often. With that background I was hesitant that this restaurant would be truly authentic despite the high reviews. Bare in mind that even in New Orleans there are some styles of gumbo I don't care for...the ones with a dark salty roux are not my favorite. This one is a bit like that and was just ok in my book. They do some items really well, like the fried fish and the voodoo shrimp. The crawfish etoufee was ok. My niece thoroughly enjoyed the food and took leftovers home. They were completely rushing us through our meal which I did not like. The restaurant is insanely loud on a weekend night. The thing that left a sour note with me is that even though I had read the reviews about the automatic gratuity I was deep in conversation while the bill was being paid by my husband who had not read these reviews. So it wasn't until well after we left that we realized our waitress got a 40% tip. She should have told him that the gratuity had already been added...and of course he should have read the receipt better.  However, it is so dark in there it was very difficult to see...even to read their menu. This is definitely more a spot for young eyes with deep pockets."
3514,Got the Wild Mushroom Jambayla for lunch - very flavorful and has a kick to it. I would definitely recommend the jambaylas if you come here. The ambience is spacious yet comfortable. I would come here again.
3515,"A great place to go out for dinner! The service here is quite good with our waitress constantly checking up on us and making sure we're okay. We ordered the butter chicken and also the crawfish etoufee. Both dishes are very good and different from each other and filling. The Butter Chicken is rich and it pairs well with the butter on the side. It is fried but not so deep fried to the point that there is oil oozing out. A must try and there is also Yam that comes on the side.The Crawfish is much lighter in comparison. The flavour is a lot more bland but strong enough that you just want to keep trying more. If you had to choose one, BUTTER CHICKEN. it is the way to go."
3516,Food was solid! No real complaints about the taste and qualityMinus one star for the service as our waiter didn't check on us for a good 20 minutes when the restaurant was just opened and empty. Refills on water is a must when eating this cuisine.
3517,"My server Bless was amazing. Thank you for serving me.. and a great first impression of the restaurant. I help manage a restaurant and you surpassed my expectations for service and attitude! I would totally hire you. Food wise it was amazing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish, and mac n cheese. So delicious.. my only issue was the bacon in the sauce of the chicken dish.. I'm sadly allergic to pork but that was my fault for not asking.. but over all the food looked and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."
3518,"Angeline's serves Cajun food that hits the spot! If you are craving it, this is the place.The menu is short and sweet. They carry the main suspects, jambalaya,gumbo, po boys,fried chicken and beignets. Recommend: The fried chicken was tender and juicy on a bed of sweet potato mash. The hush puppies were dark, but flavor was fantastic! The chicory community coffee lived up to the promise of strong bitter coffee. My friend had the Andaouille sausage and the verdict was that it was one of the tastiest. Not a fan: Creole pecan pie tasted more like caramel? The crust was brittle. The shrimps that came with the Cajun mixed grill were dry (my guess is that it's meant to be). I would definitely come back to try everything else, especially the beignets!"
3519,"I ate here with the bf and a friend today for the first time. We made a reservation via phone just in case it was busy. However, it wasn't busy when we got there. But that might be because it was after the lunch hour rush. When we got there, they had set up a table for us already that was marked reserved. The decor of the restaurant was nice. I liked all of the art work placed around the restaurant! We got the the hush puppies, Mac and cheese, jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and buttermilk chicken. Let me tell you...EVERYTHING was great. And all of the meals came in such a big portion. Do be aware that their meals are kind of pricy. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try."
