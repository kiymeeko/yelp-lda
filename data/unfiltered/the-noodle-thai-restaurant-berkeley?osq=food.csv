0,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
1,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
2,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
3,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
4,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
5,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
6,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
7,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
8,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
9,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
10,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
11,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
12,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
13,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
14,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
15,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
16,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
17,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
18,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
19,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."

Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
63,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
64,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
65,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
66,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
67,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
68,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
69,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
70,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
71,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
72,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
73,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
74,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
75,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
76,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
77,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
78,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
79,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
80,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
81,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
82,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party!

125,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
126,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
127,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
128,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
129,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
130,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
131,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
132,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
133,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
134,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
135,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
136,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
137,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
138,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
139,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
140,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
141,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
142,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
143,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
144,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers.

If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
188,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
189,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
190,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
191,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
192,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
193,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
194,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
195,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
196,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
197,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
198,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
199,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
200,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
201,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
202,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
203,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
204,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
205,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"

The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
249,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
250,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
251,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
252,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
253,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
254,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
255,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
256,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
257,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
258,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
259,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
260,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
261,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
262,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
263,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
264,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
265,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
266,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
267,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."

310,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
311,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
312,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
313,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
314,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
315,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
316,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
317,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
318,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
319,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
320,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
321,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
322,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
323,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
324,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
325,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
326,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
327,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
328,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
329,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go.

I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
374,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
375,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
376,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
377,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
378,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
379,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
380,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
381,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
382,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
383,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
384,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
385,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
386,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
387,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
388,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
389,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
390,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
391,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!

They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
435,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
436,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
437,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
438,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
439,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
440,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
441,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
442,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
443,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
444,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
445,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
446,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
447,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
448,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
449,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
450,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
451,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
452,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
453,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."

495,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
496,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
497,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
498,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
499,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
500,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
501,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
502,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
503,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
504,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
505,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
506,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
507,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
508,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
509,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
510,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
511,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
512,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
513,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
514,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food.

Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
557,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
558,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
559,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
560,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
561,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
562,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
563,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
564,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
565,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
566,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
567,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
568,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
569,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
570,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
571,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
572,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
573,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
574,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
575,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
576,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food.

You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh. It's the only place I've ever been to that gives you shrimp, chicken, AND tofu in your pad thai without making you pay extra. $9 for pad thai with ALL THREE THINGS? Yes, please! - Pad Kee Mao: I'm a fan of this dish too. I think they might call it something slightly different on the menu, but this is a dish known for its spiciness and basil flavor. - Lump Fried Rice: This is crab fried rice. They DO NOT skimp on the crab. It's really delicious and a giant portion. It's not imitation crab either. $12.95 for a generous portion of crab on my fried rice? Yes, please! Note that this is one of their specials and not on their fixed menu, so might not be around all the time. - Duck Fried Rice: This is also really delicious and a giant portion. If you're coming with a friend and you really love fried rice, maybe split the duck fried rice and the lump fried rice.I see a lot of people get the boat noodles too, so I feel like that's definitely a favorite here. I've never tried them yet even though I've been here many times - because I like their other dishes so much I keep getting them. I don't understand why this place isn't more heavily frequented/more highly rated. It's such a good Thai place. Also, the service is generally pretty good. The servers are usually pretty nice, but there is one server who we encountered who doesn't seem to like his job and was pretty surly. I'm not sure how often he works, because I've only seen him once. But someone should tell him to stop being so surly!"
617,"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't fast food that was open past 9pm. We decided to try this place because it opened until 1:30am.  We tried a bunch of their dishes and everything tasted great. Our cousin works a few blocks away and he'll definitely be back.  My favourite dishes was the papaya salad, crab meat fried rice and the fish cakes."
618,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
619,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
620,The people there are always nice and I've never had an issue with the food.1) Very tasty food (I'd recommend the pad thai)2) Good prices along with good sized portionsI usually come here to get the fried chicken over fried rice but I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and each time I have not been let down. Highly recommend.
621,"First time here at this restaurant and I'ed like to give it 5 stars! 1.) Delicious food2.) Affordable prices 3.) Large portions that they serve 4.) Cleanliness & ambiance of the restaurant 5.) Great customer service (our server Kay, was very pleasant and courteous! We ordered Thai tea (not pictured), fried chicken fried rice, and pineapple fried rice"
622,"I love coming here for some late night Thai grub. They have some of the nicest and friendliest service around, and they're very accommodating. The other night I came here with a party of 9 at 11 PM and the servers were nothing but sweet.My usual faves are their noodle soups, tom yum, pad see ew and, of course, their Thai milk tea. That night I ordered the Thai boat noodle soup, but surprisingly, it was the last to arrive out of my entire party! They apologized profusely, but we still cool.Regardless, this place has that home style cooking with a mouthful of flavor. Portions are pretty generous and I usually have a hard time finishing everything in one sitting. Prices are great - you really get the most bang for your buck here. Dinner for 2 is usually around $20 or less. This place has a hole-in-the wall feel, but I find those places to be the best (food and price wise). Win win."
623,"This Thai restaurant is soooo incredible. Trust me, if I could marry their roasted duck fried rice, I would have done it about ten years ago. IT IS AMAZING."
624,"I got the fried chicken rice, which I really liked. There was a good amount of food, enough for me to bring back leftovers. My order came promptly, but unfortunately, my friends orders took quite a while to arrive. The other time I went, I got the pad see ew, which was pretty good too. The prices were pretty good, so I would come back again."
625,"The fried chicken over fried rice is consistently my go-to dish time and time again! I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore! I'll admit, slightly embarrassed! Lol!Words can't even begin to describe and explain how good this dish is! Try it for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it!"
626,"So glad there's a place like this in Berkeley. Delicious food at stellar prices. Literally everything we had was good here. Plus, service was great and there's parking nearby. Good atmosphere too. Dishes I recommend: - pad Thai - summer rolls - green curry rice dish I can't wait to go back!"
627,"This place is no Thai Basil, but it wins second place for the best Thai food in Berkeley. If you haven't been here before and you're too lazy to walk down to the Asian Ghetto, I recommend trying this place out! Their late hours are awesome too. It's the perfect spot to grab some food after a show at the Greek, especially since it's next to BART.I appreciate the modern decor here. It doesn't look like a hole-in-a-wall, but the prices are still cheap and affordable. Service is always friendly and on point."
628,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
629,"The noodle company is not a bad place to go. I really like their fried chicken over fried rice, and it is one of my go to places to take a friend or two for  the purpose of catching up and conversing. However, I wouldn't say it is amazing and worth going out of your way for. It is solid Thai food."
630,Best khao soi I've ever had! Great service and one of the few places open late.
631,I came here for dinner and was really impressed with my meal. I got the tofu garlic noodles and thought it was the most delicious I've had in the Bay Area. The service was stellar. Dessert was delicious. Will be coming back!
632,The best Thai food I've ever had. Chicken salad is a must everyone loves it. Pumpkin curry shrimp is my sister's favorite​ dish. Don't forget the chicken satay. Open super late and always has the best service!
633,"It's been a while since I was last here and the restaurant name has changed since then. Small cozy restaurant and friendly servers. Become a regular and they'll remember your order lol. I loved the panang curry, never had beef stew meat in a panang curry before but it was sooo good. I ordered it extra spicy and was perfect. I also ordered the papaya salad, lao style but of course you can't expect too much with that lol it still tasted like thai style papaya salad. The thai ice tea was really milky and super sweet, a little too much for me. It's a favorite thai spot for the folks I came here with so no doubt I'll be back again."
634,"I had a great experience here! My friends and I came in at midnight and the staff was still energetic and friendly. They walked us through the menu and checked in on us a couple of times to see how we liked the food. One of the cooks kept looking over and smiling as she watched us enjoy her food, it was so cute! :)The Noodle Company took the place of Thai Noodle, but it's basically the same menu and quality of food. I had the pad kee mao which is one of my favorite thai dishes, and it was delicious. None of the dishes we got were spicy, which was surprising for a thai restaurant but there are different sauces at each table you can use. The portions are large and great for eating family style!"
635,"Thom Kha J is a warm & semi-healthy choice as late night eating. Their Chief specials are generally worthy trying: the eggplant and Avocado Fresh Rolls. Shrimp Salad is also delicious :) I like their Pad Thai over that of Bangkok, not that sweetened but quite fulfilling."
636,"Ok, between this place and Lers Ros, the Bay Area has got me covered for Thai food. I absolutely love Thai food, and I usually judge each place on the most popular Thai dishes - pad thai and pad kee mao (drunken noodles). If you do those two well, then I'm totally sold. So this place is a little different than Lers Ros. Lers Ros is definitely more expensive, with more sophisticated presentation and decor. Thai Noodle is cheaper, and more of a take-out Thai sort of place. They're totally different types of Thai places, and they fill different holes in my heart when I'm craving Thai. This place provides pretty good food at a very decent price, and the portions are very generous. Here's what I've sampled here so far (I honestly haven't had a bad dish yet). - Spring Rolls: This is the biggest portion of spring rolls I've ever seen. Usually places just give you four. At Thai noodle, they give you EIGHT. It's definitely enough to split between four people as an appetizer. And it's always good because they clearly use fresh ingredients. - Pad Thai: This is definitely my go-to dish because they do it so well here. You can see the kitchen from your seat usually, and you can tell they make it fresh and then serve it to you hot and fresh.
