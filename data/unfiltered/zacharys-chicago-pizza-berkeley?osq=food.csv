0,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
2,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
3,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
4,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
5,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
6,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
7,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
8,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
9,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
10,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
11,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
12,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
13,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
14,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
15,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
16,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
17,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
18,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
19,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"

It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
31,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
32,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
33,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
34,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
35,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
36,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
37,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
38,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
39,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
40,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
41,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
42,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
43,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
44,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
45,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
46,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
47,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
48,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
49,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
50,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices.

62,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
63,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
64,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
65,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
66,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
67,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
68,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
69,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
70,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
71,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
72,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
73,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
74,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
75,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
76,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
77,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
78,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
79,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
80,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
81,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."

I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
92,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
93,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
94,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
95,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
96,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
97,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
98,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
99,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
100,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
101,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
102,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
103,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
104,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
105,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
106,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
107,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
108,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
109,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
110,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
111,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.

123,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
124,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
125,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
126,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
127,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
128,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
129,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
130,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
131,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
132,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
133,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
134,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
135,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
136,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
137,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
138,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
139,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
140,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
141,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
142,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
153,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
154,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
155,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
156,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
157,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
158,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
159,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
160,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
161,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
162,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
163,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
164,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
165,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
166,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
167,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
168,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
169,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
170,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
171,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
185,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
186,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
187,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
188,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
189,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
190,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
191,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
192,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
193,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
194,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
195,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
196,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
197,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
198,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
199,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
200,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
201,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
202,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
203,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
204,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday.

And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
216,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
217,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
218,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
219,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
220,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
221,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
222,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
223,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
224,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
225,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
226,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
227,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
228,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
229,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
230,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
231,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
232,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
233,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
234,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
235,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad.

247,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
248,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
249,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
250,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
251,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
252,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
253,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
254,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
255,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
256,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
257,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
258,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
259,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
260,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
261,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
262,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
263,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
264,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
265,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
266,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."

We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
280,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
281,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
282,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
283,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
284,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
285,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
286,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
287,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
288,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
289,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
290,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
291,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
292,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
293,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
294,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
295,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
296,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
297,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
298,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
299,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go!

The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
311,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
312,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
313,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
314,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
315,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
316,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
317,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
318,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
319,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
320,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
321,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
322,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
323,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
324,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
325,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
326,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
327,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
328,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
329,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
330,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house.

Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
342,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
343,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
344,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
345,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
346,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
347,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
348,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
349,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
350,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
351,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
352,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
353,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
354,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
355,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
356,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
357,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
358,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
359,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
360,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
361,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us.

I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
371,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
372,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
373,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
374,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
375,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
376,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
377,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
378,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
379,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
380,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
381,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
382,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
383,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
384,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
385,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
386,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
387,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
388,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
389,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
390,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza.

403,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
404,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
405,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
406,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
407,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
408,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
409,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
410,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
411,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
412,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
413,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
414,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
415,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
416,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
417,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
418,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
419,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
420,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
421,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
422,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
433,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
434,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
435,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
436,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
437,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
438,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
439,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
440,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
441,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
442,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
443,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
444,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
445,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
446,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
447,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
448,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
449,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
450,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
451,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
465,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
466,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
467,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
468,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
469,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
470,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
471,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
472,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
473,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
474,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
475,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
476,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
477,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
478,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
479,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
480,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
481,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
482,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
483,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
484,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday.

And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
496,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
497,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
498,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
499,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
500,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
501,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
502,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
503,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
504,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
505,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
506,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
507,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
508,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
509,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
510,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
511,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
512,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
513,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
514,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
515,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad.

527,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
528,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
529,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
530,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
531,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
532,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
533,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
534,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
535,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
536,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
537,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
538,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
539,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
540,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
541,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
542,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
543,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
544,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
545,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
546,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."

We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
560,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
561,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
562,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
563,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
564,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
565,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
566,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
567,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
568,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
569,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
570,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
571,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
572,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
573,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
574,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
575,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
576,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
577,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
578,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
579,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go!

The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
591,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
592,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
593,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
594,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
595,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
596,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
597,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
598,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
599,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
600,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
601,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
602,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
603,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
604,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
605,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
606,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
607,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
608,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
609,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
610,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated.

Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
622,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
623,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
624,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
625,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
626,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
627,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
628,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
629,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
630,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
631,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
632,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
633,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
634,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
635,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
636,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
637,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
638,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
639,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
640,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
641,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us.

I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
651,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
652,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
653,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
654,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
655,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
656,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
657,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
658,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
659,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
660,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
661,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
662,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
663,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
664,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
665,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
666,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
667,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
668,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
669,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
670,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza.

683,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
684,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
685,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
686,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
687,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
688,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
689,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
690,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
691,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
692,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
693,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
694,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
695,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
696,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
697,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
698,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
699,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
700,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
701,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
702,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
713,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
714,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
715,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
716,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
717,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
718,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
719,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
720,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
721,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
722,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
723,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
724,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
725,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
726,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
727,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
728,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
729,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
730,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
731,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
745,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
746,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
747,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
748,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
749,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
750,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
751,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
752,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
753,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
754,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
755,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
756,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
757,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
758,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
759,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
760,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
761,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
762,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
763,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
764,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday.

And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
776,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
777,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
778,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
779,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
780,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
781,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
782,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
783,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
784,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
785,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
786,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
787,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
788,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
789,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
790,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
791,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
792,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
793,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
794,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
795,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad.

807,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
808,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
809,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
810,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
811,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
812,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
813,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
814,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
815,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
816,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
817,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
818,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
819,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
820,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
821,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
822,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
823,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
824,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
825,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
826,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."

We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
840,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
841,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
842,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
843,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
844,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
845,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
846,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
847,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
848,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
849,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
850,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
851,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
852,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
853,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
854,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
855,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
856,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
857,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
858,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
859,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go!

The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
871,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
872,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
873,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
874,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
875,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
876,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
877,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
878,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
879,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
880,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
881,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
882,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
883,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
884,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
885,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
886,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
887,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
888,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
889,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
890,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated.

Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
902,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
903,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
904,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
905,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
906,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
907,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
908,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
909,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
910,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
911,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
912,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
913,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
914,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
915,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
916,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
917,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
918,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
919,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
920,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
921,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us.

I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
931,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
932,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
933,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
934,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
935,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
936,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
937,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
938,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
939,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
940,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
941,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
942,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
943,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
944,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
945,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
946,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
947,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
948,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
949,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
950,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza.

963,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
964,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
965,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
966,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
967,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
968,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
969,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
970,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
971,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
972,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
973,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
974,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
975,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
976,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
977,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
978,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
979,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
980,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
981,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
982,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
993,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
994,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
995,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
996,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
997,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
998,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
999,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1000,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1001,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1002,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1003,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1004,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1005,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1006,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1007,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1008,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1009,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1010,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1011,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1025,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1026,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1027,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1028,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1029,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1030,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1031,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1032,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1033,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1034,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1035,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1036,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1037,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1038,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1039,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1040,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1041,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1042,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1043,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"

We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1056,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1057,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1058,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1059,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1060,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1061,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1062,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1063,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1064,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1065,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1066,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1067,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1068,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1069,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1070,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1071,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1072,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1073,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1074,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1075,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews.

As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1087,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1088,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1089,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1090,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1091,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1092,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1093,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1094,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1095,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1096,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1097,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1098,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1099,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1100,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1101,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1102,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1103,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1104,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1105,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1106,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up.

It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1119,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1120,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1121,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1122,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1123,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1124,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1125,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1126,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1127,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1128,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1129,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1130,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1131,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1132,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1133,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1134,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1135,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1136,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1137,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1138,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy.

He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1151,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1152,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1153,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1154,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1155,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1156,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1157,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1158,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1159,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1160,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1161,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1162,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1163,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1164,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1165,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1166,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1167,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1168,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1169,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1170,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders.

I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1182,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1183,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1184,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1185,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1186,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1187,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1188,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1189,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1190,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1191,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1192,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1193,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1194,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1195,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1196,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1197,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1198,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1199,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1200,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1201,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting.

This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1211,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1212,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1213,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1214,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1215,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1216,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1217,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1218,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1219,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1220,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1221,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1222,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1223,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1224,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1225,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1226,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1227,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1228,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1229,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1230,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon.

SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1243,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1244,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1245,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1246,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1247,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1248,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1249,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1250,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1251,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1252,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1253,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1254,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1255,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1256,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1257,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1258,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1259,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1260,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1261,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."

I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1272,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1273,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1274,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1275,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1276,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1277,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1278,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1279,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1280,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1281,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1282,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1283,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1284,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1285,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1286,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1287,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1288,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1289,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1290,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1291,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.

1303,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1304,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1305,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1306,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1307,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1308,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1309,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1310,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1311,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1312,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1313,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1314,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1315,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1316,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1317,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1318,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1319,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1320,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1321,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1322,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

1332,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1333,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1334,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1335,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1336,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1337,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1338,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1339,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1340,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1341,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1342,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1343,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1344,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1345,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1346,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1347,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1348,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1349,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1350,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1351,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

1364,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1365,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1366,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1367,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1368,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1369,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1370,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1371,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1372,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1373,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1374,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1375,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1376,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1377,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1378,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1379,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1380,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1381,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1382,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1383,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"

1395,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1396,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1397,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1398,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1399,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1400,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1401,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1402,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1403,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1404,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1405,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1406,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1407,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1408,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1409,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1410,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1411,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1412,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1413,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1414,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"

1426,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1427,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1428,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1429,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1430,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1431,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1432,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1433,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1434,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1435,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1436,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1437,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1438,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1439,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1440,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1441,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1442,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1443,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1444,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1445,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"

I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1459,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1460,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1461,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1462,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1463,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1464,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1465,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1466,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1467,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1468,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1469,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1470,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1471,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1472,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1473,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1474,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1475,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1476,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."

From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1491,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1492,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1493,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1494,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1495,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1496,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1497,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1498,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1499,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1500,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1501,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1502,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1503,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1504,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1505,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1506,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1507,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1508,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1509,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."

He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1522,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1523,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1524,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1525,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1526,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1527,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1528,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1529,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1530,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1531,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1532,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1533,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1534,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1535,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1536,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1537,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1538,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1539,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1540,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.

The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1551,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1552,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1553,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1554,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1555,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1556,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1557,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1558,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1559,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1560,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1561,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1562,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1563,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1564,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1565,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1566,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1567,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1568,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1569,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1570,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices.

1582,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1583,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1584,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1585,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1586,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1587,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1588,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1589,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1590,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1591,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1592,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1593,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1594,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1595,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1596,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1597,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1598,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1599,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1600,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1601,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."

I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1612,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1613,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1614,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1615,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1616,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1617,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1618,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1619,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1620,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1621,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1622,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1623,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1624,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1625,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1626,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1627,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1628,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1629,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1630,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1631,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings.

1643,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1644,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1645,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1646,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1647,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1648,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1649,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1650,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1651,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1652,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1653,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1654,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1655,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1656,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1657,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1658,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1659,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1660,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1661,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1662,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza.

1672,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1673,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1674,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1675,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1676,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1677,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1678,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1679,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
1680,Craving deep dish pizza? Not anywhere near Chicago? No problem! Zachary's is about as good as it gets. The crust is tasty yet structurally sound and keeps it all together. The sauce is to die for!The staff is friendly and responsive. It's a plus that this location is less busy than Berkeley/Oakland.
1681,"If you're in the mood for some serious Deep Dish pizza, Zachary's does not disappoint. If you're wondering whether or not to go, I'd definitely recommend you going and giving it a try!I came to Zachary's per my roommate's request to treat them to their last meal in Berkeley- as he was moving back home down to Southern California the next day. He had designated Zachary's to be his last meal for several reasons- remembering fondly of how his first roommate would come every other week and make the trek here because he loved it here so much; and also because of how legendary Zachary's is for their deep dish pizza. Hearing all of these stories made me extremely curious to see what Zachary's was all about.The ambiance was really nice, and the adornment of artwork on the wall felt very homely and comforting. The servers here are also really pleasant as well- I was quickly seated and they were very helpful when asked for recommendations. I had also come during dinner rush, and although I was seated relatively quickly- I'd also warn in advance if you have a large party you may have to wait much longer.We first ordered the Ceser Salad- Which was nice. Nothing to write home about- but still a good salad. Adorned with croutons and tiny breadsticks- it was a nice transition to have before we were to go dive into the depths of the deep dish pizza.Our party split a medium BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza between 3 people- quickly finding out that the pizza definitely bested us. I only had 2 slices and was completely full- When they say deep dish it truly is DEEP. We ended up happily taking home leftovers after. Also a note- it does take awhile for the people in the back to cook a deep dish- so if you're starving and looking for a fast meal- this isn't the place to be. They really take their time prepping and cooking it back there.The pie did not disappoint, however one complaint I had with my BBQ Chicken deep dish was that I didn't taste much meat inside the pizza, as it was drowning in their infamous pizza sauce. Their sauce is loaded in rich, thick chunks of tomato which was extremely flavor packed but overloaded. Though the pizza itself was good, there was a LOT of tomato chunks you have to chow down through, and looking back I remember only tasting a few morsels of chicken throughout. In my opinion, a bit of sauce overkill, but it was still an amazing deep dish pizza.Overall in my book- a solid 4. I'd definitely recommend coming to Zachary's if you've never been before, as I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go. In my opinion their deep dish isn't something I could eat everyday as it is very heavy- but it's definitely a special place for a deep dish pie."
1682,"Been craving Zachary's for a long time; it's been at least 10 years since I've had deep dish pizza from Zachary's, so I'm so glad we made a purposeful trip this weekend to order Zachary's while we were in the Bay Area. We drove from Sausalito to Berkeley to pick up a small pizza, customized to our liking. We got: pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, sausage and fresh garlic in our deep dish pizza; the total was $29.33. SO WORTH IT. It was 6 slices, packed with flavor and stuffed with loads of topping. We got it to-go, so it was ready to pick-up within 35-40 minutes of your phone call. This location is definitely less busy than the North Oakland location, so we arrived, got our box of pizza and off we went. Fast and great customer service. This was my husband's first time having Zachary's, and even tho he's not even a deep dish pizza fan; he kept nodding his head in agreement that this was legitimate Chicago style pizza -- even better than the ones he's had in Chicago! :) I can't wait to come back again in the future to order more Zachary's when we are craving deep dish pizza. YUM :)"
1683,"After our little snack at Top Dog, we headed on down here for some pizza!  My friend was meeting us and arrived a bit before we did.  She got us a table and placed the order for our pizza.  We went with a Large Zachary's Special (Sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom) pizza, and a Spinach Salad.  Soon after we arrived, our pizza was ready!  Here is how it was..............Zachary's Special-  This thing looked amazing!  For never really eating deep dish pizza, I have had it quite a bit in the last few months.  In my previous review of another spot (Tony's Little Italy), I mentioned that my pallet may not be as refined towards deep dish as it is towards NY thin crust.  I think that may be changing though!  Zachary's pizzas toppings were great (really good cheese, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms), but their sauce and crust left just a tad to be desired.  The sauce had way too many chunks of tomatoes in it.  I would have preferred a ""smoother"" sauce.  I picked out a lot of the tomatoes and pushed them to the side.  The crust also wasn't as good as other deep dish pizzas I have had.  It didn't have anything that stuck out about it, and it was pretty plain tasting.  Meh.  Overall though, still a pretty tasty deep dish pizza.Spinach Salad-  This was good!  We shared it between the 4 of us (it was stretching it a bit..probably shared with 2 or 3 people would be better) and each got a little plate full of spinach.  They had really good crutons/breadsitck things in this salad as well as a good amount of feta cheese and onions.  We got a vinaigrette dressing and it was pretty tasty. Overall, it was a good meal. The pizza was probably 3/3.5 stars, and I have had better deep dish elsewhere, but the other things made up for it.  Service was fantastic, company was excellent, and the price was reasonable.  I would come back.  Maybe try out their thin pizza next time?  We shall see.  Definitely glad I got to try Zachary's out though!"
1684,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1685,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1686,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1687,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1688,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1689,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1690,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1691,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."

1704,"Deep dish is my favorite type of pizza, and the deep dish here doesn't disappoint!From the reviews, it seems like usually there is a pretty long wait around dinner time, especially on the weekend, but my friends and I were able to get seated immediately during prime dinner time on Saturday. Apparently we came during the right weekend, that awkward time after graduation but before any summer activities have started, so there were very few people around. Score!We ordered two large deep dish pizzas for the seven of us and that was just enough. One of the pizzas we got with vegan cheese to try it out, and while it was decent, I still preferred the real deal. Of the two pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the Carne pizza, which is very appropriately named as it comes with chorizo sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon, and mozzarella. The best part about the whole pizza was the thick and hearty layer of tomato sauce that smothers the rest of the toppings. Now that's what I call a real deep dish pizza!The other pizza we ordered was the spinach and mushroom, and while that was good for a vegetarian pizza, the carnivore in me much preferred the meatier Carne pizza.The pizza here is really filling. I ate two slices and walked out stuffed, and was still pretty full when I woke up the next morning. (or maybe that's just me) Parking is all on the street. There were multiple spots open less than a block away from Zachary's, but again that's probably due to the scarcity of people around.The total pp came to about $15 which is a crazy steal for how filling this meal was. Definitely want to come back again and try their other pizzas!"
1705,"My sister and I came here yesterday for dinner before a concert. We ordered a small deep dish Carne pizza and it was really good. Perfect size, because us fatties ate the whole thing. Lol. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes for seating, but we were  able to get our pizza ordered while waiting which was nice! Service was friendly and I really liked the different pizza art on the walls and menus! Very nice touch in my opinion. I'd come back!"
1706,"I've heard so many great things about Zachary's and their deep dish but it didn't really meet all of my expectations of what I would've wanted in a deep dish pizza. We ordered half spinach and mushroom and half of the weekly special which was hot link. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out. I was underwhelmed by it. It just tastes more of sauce than anything else to me. The crust was super hard and tough. It could've just been an off day but there wasn't anything that made me want to eat another slice after I had one. As for sizing goes if it's just two people a small is more than enough to fill both of you guys up. The service was great, our server made sure to check up on us and gave us frequent updates of when our pizza would be ready."
1707,"My wife apparently went to Zachary's a bazillion times before we met and loves the place.  I much prefer Zelda's in Sacramento for deep dish but to each his own - however I am right on this pizza thing.The deep dish they serve is good, love the sauce.  The salads are almost as good as the deep dish but the thin crust pizzas are gaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage - terrible terrible crust.  Shockingly bad crust.Folks that work there are friendly - goofball ordering system but it's close enough to Berkeley that goofball is normal."
1708,"I love Zachary's! My favorite pizza place. Everytime I visit Northern Cali I have to stop here to eat. And this location is the closest to my Grandmas house. Although I've tried all the different pizzas. My ultimate all-time favorite is still the Spinach and Mushrooms. This particular deep dish pizza is the one I compare all other deep dish pizzas to. Super cheesy and flavorful. With lots of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. Its so amazing. I highly recommend that you try it."
1709,"Best vegan and gluten free pizza I have ever been able to find!! We get take out or eat here regularly now that we've discovered it! In fact, we have cravings just for Zachary's."
1710,"Since The Cheeseboard was closed on Sundays, our group of seven ended up at Zachary's for dinner. I still want to try Cheeseboard sometime, but I'm not complaining -- Zachary's had deep dish pizza, and I haven't had much of it in my life thus far. From the moment you walk in, you can tell that Zachary's is a hotspot - the restaurant isn't that big, but it's packed, and there's a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders. We put our name in and were told the wait would be about an hour, but they would come into the bookstore next door to call us. Thank goodness for that bookstore ... we were able to stay out of the cold and peruse all the used books while we waited.Before we left Zachary's, however, the employee told us to check out the menu and put in our pizza orders beforehand. He said one deep dish took about 40 minutes, and since our group was ordering three pizzas, we narrowed down our selections in the meantime. This proved to be helpful and minimized the waiting time once we actually got our seats. Well, about 1.5 hours after we put our name in, we were finally seated. The party whose table we were waiting for took forever ... and the manager was so nice. He knew our group waited for a long time, so he gave us a round of beers on the house. The tables are really close together, but I think by that time, our group was just so happy to be seated--and starving--that we didn't care about the proximity of the next table.We shared three different pizzas -- two deep dish and one thin crust (create it yourself). Everything we ordered was delicious, and we even had about two slices of each pizza as leftovers. Those deep dish slices definitely fill you up!I would recommend Zachary's if you've never been before, and I did like the pizza a lot. I normally don't like a lot of tomato sauce on my pizza, so for the deep dish ones, I ate some of the tomato sauce and scraped off the rest when it became too much. Just be prepared--mentally and physically--for a long wait, especially if you have a bigger party. Here's what we got: ""Spinach and Mushroom"": Since this is the pizza Zachary's is well known for, we decided that should be one of our choices. It featured fresh spinach, mushrooms and a blend of three cheeses. I loved the thin layer of spinach, as well as the cheesy layer, and the mushrooms gave the pizza some extra texture and chewiness. The dough was cooked perfectly -- it wasn't super crispy, but I liked it a little doughier and chewier. My friends who had been to Chicago said it wasn't as good as the pizza they had in Chicago, but it sufficed for California and said it was close enough. I really liked this pizza; it was lighter than the other meaty option we got, and it's a good one if you want a ""safe"" pizza. ""Carne"": We had a bunch of meat eaters in our group, so naturally, this pizza resulted. It came topped with Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, chopped bacon and mozzarella. This pizza was hearty and flavorful, but I actually couldn't taste too much of the meat except for the sausage and chopped bacon. The bacon had to be the crowning glory and the most definite ingredient -- it was crispy and the bits on top the pizza were plentiful. The other meats had to be underneath all that tomato sauce I scraped off. I was happy we tried this and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sausage and bacon (those were the two meats I could taste the most of).""Caesar Salad"": We started off our meal with two salads. I liked this one better of the two. It was your traditional Caesar, comprising Romaine lettuce tossed with Zachary's Caesar dressing, croutons and aged parmesan. I loved all the cheese that came on the salad, but a handful more of croutons would have made it absolutely perfect.""Create Your Own Pizza"": The last pizza we got was a thin crust pizza. One of my friends loves anchovies, so he wanted to make one with anchovies. The thin crust pizza he got comprised tomatoes and anchovies. He said it was yummy, but you definitely had to be an anchovy lover to enjoy this pizza. I was satisfied with the other two deep dish varieties we got."
1711,"If you're from the East Bay, you know there aren't many things better than the deep dish pizza pies from Zachary's. Food: We were surprised to find a large menu due to the size of the actual restaurant. Zachary's offers plenty of house specialty deep dish pies and regular thin pizzas, along with customizable BYO pies and thin pizzas. My sister and I opted for a small pie, half California and half Good Health. I like that they let you customize your pie and also let you order half and half, it's a nice option when you're dining with someone with different cravings. I also appreciated that they had a slightly ""healthier"" option on the menu known as the Good Health, which comes with low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust. For being low-fat, the cheese melted perfectly. The sauce was very hearty and bold and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I had dined at another Zachary's location prior to this experience and I will admit that between locations, the taste is consistent and delicious.Ambiance: Unique restaurant with cool art pieces and a cozy and clean environment. Price: Comparable to other Chicago style pizzerias in the area (Patxi, etc.)Service: My server was nice, however the rest of the staff kept looking at us the entire time because my eight month old nephew was crying. I understand how stressful it may be to dine somewhere with a crying baby, but we felt so uncomfortable by their stares and mugs that we had our food immediately boxed and took it home. Other than our server, the staff showed no mercy.Overall: Delicious Chicago style pizza with fair prices, however the experience I had with the staff made me feel uncomfortable and completely unwelcome. However, due to my personal experience with staff, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to this particular location."
1712,"Service was excellent. Lovely gal who serve us was super nice, polite, excellent service. Unbelievable nice. Thank you. Sorry I did not get her name. Our kale salad was off the hook. Delicate but hardy. I couldn't believe it was thinly slice green apples, if had a nice tang to it. The feta cheese and pumpkin seeds made it hardy."
1713,Disappointed. The crust for the thick crust and think crust was crouton like hard. It's not worth it. Overpriced. We had better pizza at Round Table. Service is great though.
1714,"Hands down to the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life and in my opinion, this is better than Chicago's famous deep dish pizza (I swear). My friends and I hiked at Tilden Regional Park before coming to pig out, so we could devour all we want without guilt or regrets. We decided to order a large size of half carne (sausage, salami, bacon & mozzarella cheese & half of good health (chicken breast, spinach & mozzarella cheese), the price of the deep dish pizza was fair, which costed $36 and fed a party of 6 people. The deep dish pizza was stuffed with all the delicious and fresh ingredients and layered up with loads of mozzarella cheese and on the top, it was just filled up with all tomato sauce. After waited for about 30mins, the hot deep dish pizza came out with all saucy, cheesy and deliciously mouth-watering and backed in perfection. It was so worth it to consume every bit of calories. Oh boy! This was what foodgasm felt like when you started biting into that slice of deep dish pizza, and their pizza crust (OMG!!) it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely come back to try other kinds of deep dish pizza. Pizza is life and THANK YOU - Zachery's Chicago pizza, you made me experienced, seriously, the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. Can't wait to go back there again! And, the customer service was great too!"
1715,"I'm honestly curious to know what the hype is. Because after trying it, I don't see it.Firstly, before walking in one is super excited because all of lovely positive reviews. Then, you walk in and bunch of people are standing around just looking at one another faces. There's no one to approach you when you walk in, no sense of direction whatsoever. So, I assumed you walk up to the register and order. We stand in line, get to the register and as we are about to order we are informed we have to give our name to the host and then when they give us a paper only then we can place an order for dining in. So. Then we look in the middle of the dining area to place our name on the list. Then we order our food. They don't have certain fresh veggies but instead use pickled/canned.Then, begins the waiting period. As we stood near the door, at least 5 people asked me how they can place their name on the wait list. And, I'm sure after we got suited someone else had the duty of answering this question.We were so glad to get seated and didn't mind the wait as it was a sat night. We ordered a Caesar salad. We had ordered Blanca pizza and Italian chicken sausage in thin crust. Our pizza arrived before the salad. We dug into pizza and please explain to me what thin crust means? It was regular crust and quite thick. The Blanca had no flavor. And Italian chicken sausage, we honestly thought they forgot to place the sausage on it. And then we looked closely and there was one piece each on each slice. The best thing we ate here was the Caesar salad. Our server checked on us multiple times and that was kind of him. Honestly, please don't waste your time and money here."
1716,"Have to give 1 star for attitude.  Never have I ever felt more unwelcome and getting money so rudely, snatched out of my hand. Not sure I'll be back... good pizza or not, I just don't frequent places where the customer is treated as a nuisance."
1717,Spinach mushroom deep dish pizza was ordered by my best friend. Really good almost tastes like lasagna. One star off for crust being a bit hard.
1718,"VEGAN & GLUTEN FREE REVIEWI've written my fair share of reviews for Zach's, so I won't go too in-depth on this one. I just wanted to update my review on their new vegan cheese that they've started to use. I guess they are no longer using Daiya, because at my last visit, the cheese was noticeably different. I asked the waitress what cheese they switched to (because I'm paranoid and don't trust peoples' definitions of vegan) and she said they're now using ""Vegan Gourmet Shreds"" by Follow Your Heart. I love Follow Your Heart and I know they're vegan, so I gobbled up my pizza, but I have to say I think I prefer Daiya on my pizzas. When Daiya melts, its texture is more cheesy. It also burns a little and gets crunchy which I really like. The Follow Your Heart cheese is more creamy and the mouth feel reminds me of a cream sauce almost. Don't get me wrong - it was really yummy. It just comes down to the texture."
1719,"Finally made it in here! And if you haven't been here, put this place on your list and go! We came into this location because we were in the area but I want to believe it's less busy here because I always see a crowd of people waiting at other location but maybe we just got lucky and didn't have to wait a minute here. The staff was very helpful with getting our vegan pizza done right! And don't get me wrong it may be a bit pricey, yes but if I'm going to spend $30+ on a pizza - it's gonna be this pizza! Good stuff!"
