0,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
1,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
2,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
3,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
4,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
5,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
6,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
7,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
8,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
9,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
10,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
11,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
12,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
13,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
14,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
15,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
16,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
17,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
18,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
19,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
20,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside.

It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."

I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
36,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
37,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
38,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
39,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
40,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
41,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
42,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
43,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
44,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
45,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
46,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
47,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
48,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
49,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
50,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
51,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
52,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
53,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
54,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
55,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"

My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
74,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
75,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
76,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
77,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
78,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
79,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
80,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
81,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
82,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
83,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
84,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
85,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
86,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
87,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
88,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
89,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
90,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
91,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
92,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
93,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day.

Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
111,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
112,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
113,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
114,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
115,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
116,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
117,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
118,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
119,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
120,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
121,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
122,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
123,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
124,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
125,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
126,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
127,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
128,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
129,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
130,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise.

It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
147,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
148,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
149,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
150,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
151,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
152,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
153,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
154,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
155,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
156,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
157,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
158,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
159,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
160,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
161,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
162,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
163,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
164,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
165,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
166,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area.

We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
184,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
185,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
186,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
187,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
188,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
189,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
190,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
191,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
192,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
193,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
194,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
195,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
196,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
197,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
198,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
199,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
200,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
201,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
202,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"

I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
220,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
221,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
222,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
223,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
224,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
225,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
226,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
227,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
228,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
229,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
230,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
231,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
232,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
233,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
234,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
235,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
236,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
237,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
238,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
239,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes.

I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
255,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
256,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
257,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
258,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
259,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
260,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
261,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
262,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
263,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
264,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
265,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
266,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
267,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
268,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
269,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
270,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
271,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
272,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
273,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
274,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part.

Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
294,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
295,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
296,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
297,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
298,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
299,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
300,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
301,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
302,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
303,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
304,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
305,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
306,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
307,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
308,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
309,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
310,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
311,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
312,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
313,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful.

328,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
329,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
330,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
331,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
332,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
333,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
334,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
335,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
336,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
337,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
338,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
339,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
340,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
341,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
342,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
343,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
344,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
345,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
346,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
347,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
348,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."

They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
366,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
367,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
368,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
369,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
370,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
371,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
372,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
373,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
374,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
375,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
376,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
377,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
378,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
379,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
380,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
381,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
382,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
383,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
384,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
385,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."

They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
403,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
404,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
405,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
406,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
407,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
408,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
409,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
410,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
411,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
412,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
413,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
414,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
415,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
416,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
417,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
418,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
419,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
420,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
421,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
422,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"

Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
439,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
440,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
441,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
442,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
443,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
444,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
445,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
446,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
447,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
448,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
449,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
450,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
451,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
452,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
453,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
454,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
455,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
456,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
457,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
458,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit.

The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
474,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
475,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
476,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
477,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
478,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
479,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
480,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
481,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
482,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
483,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
484,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
485,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
486,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
487,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
488,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
489,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
490,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
491,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
492,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
493,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"

There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
514,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
515,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
516,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
517,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
518,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
519,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
520,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
521,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
522,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
523,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
524,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
525,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
526,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
527,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
528,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
529,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
530,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
531,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
532,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."

Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
548,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
549,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
550,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
551,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
552,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
553,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
554,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
555,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
556,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
557,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
558,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
559,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
560,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
561,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
562,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
563,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
564,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
565,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
566,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."

Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake.

I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
585,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
586,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
587,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
588,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
589,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
590,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
591,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
592,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
593,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
594,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
595,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
596,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
597,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
598,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
599,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
600,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
601,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
602,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
603,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
604,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype.

Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
622,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
623,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
624,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
625,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
626,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
627,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
628,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
629,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
630,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
631,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
632,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
633,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
634,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
635,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
636,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
637,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
638,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
639,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
640,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
641,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing.

Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
658,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
659,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
660,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
661,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
662,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
663,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
664,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
665,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
666,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
667,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
668,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
669,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
670,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
671,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
672,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
673,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
674,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
675,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
676,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
677,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious!

I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
694,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
695,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
696,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
697,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
698,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
699,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
700,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
701,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
702,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
703,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
704,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
705,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
706,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
707,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
708,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
709,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
710,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
711,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
712,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
713,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko.

731,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
732,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
733,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
734,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
735,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
736,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
737,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
738,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
739,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
740,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
741,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
742,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
743,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
744,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
745,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
746,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
747,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
748,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
749,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
750,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
751,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"

The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
767,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
768,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
769,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
770,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
771,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
772,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
773,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
774,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
775,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
776,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
777,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
778,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
779,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
780,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
781,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
782,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
783,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
784,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
785,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
786,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away.

I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
805,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
806,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
807,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
808,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
809,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
810,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
811,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
812,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
813,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
814,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
815,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
816,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
817,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
818,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
819,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
820,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
821,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
822,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
823,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
824,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner.

It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
841,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
842,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
843,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
844,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
845,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
846,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
847,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
848,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
849,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
850,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
851,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
852,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
853,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
854,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
855,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
856,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
857,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
858,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
859,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
860,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon.

My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city.

876,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
877,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
878,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
879,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
880,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
881,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
882,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
883,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
884,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
885,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
886,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
887,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
888,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
889,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
890,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
891,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
892,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
893,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
894,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
895,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"

My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
914,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
915,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
916,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
917,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
918,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
919,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
920,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
921,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
922,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
923,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
924,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
925,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
926,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
927,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
928,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
929,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
930,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
931,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
932,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
933,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home.

Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
951,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
952,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
953,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
954,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
955,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
956,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
957,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
958,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
959,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
960,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
961,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
962,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
963,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
964,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
965,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
966,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
967,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
968,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
969,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
970,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise.

It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
987,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
988,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
989,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
990,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
991,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
992,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
993,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
994,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
995,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
996,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
997,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
998,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
999,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
1000,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
1001,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
1002,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
1003,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
1004,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
1005,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
1006,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors.

We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
1024,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
1025,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
1026,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
1027,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
1028,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
1029,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
1030,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
1031,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
1032,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
1033,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
1034,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
1035,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
1036,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
1037,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
1038,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
1039,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
1040,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
1041,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
1042,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
1043,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed.

1059,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
1060,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
1061,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
1062,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
1063,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
1064,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
1065,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
1066,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
1067,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
1068,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
1069,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
1070,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
1071,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
1072,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
1073,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
1074,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
1075,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
1076,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
1077,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
1078,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."

I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
1095,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
1096,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
1097,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
1098,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
1099,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
1100,"Preparing for my SF road trip, I was ready to yelp and research places to eat. This place was on that list. Look at all those reviews and stars. This place is good. I went with my friends one Monday morning and it was empty. We sat outside. I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, my sister got the classic french toast and my friend and her bf I think got the combo breakfast. The benedict was so good. I wasn't expecting so much bacon. It was crispy and filling and the breakfast potatoes was legit the best thing I've eaten. My sister and I were debating on ordering some more but we had to convince ourselves that we were going to eat more in the city. The french toast was fluffy and yummy and my sister devoured it, I was really focused on the benedict so I am truly sorry I can't describe the french toast as accurately. Right before we had to head back to the OC, we ate here again. It was a unanimous 5/5 stars. Please, if you're in the area (or if you're not) this place is worth the travel and wait."
1101,"Went around 11 on a Sunday with the girls. The wait was about 40 minutes and they gave us a little timer beepy thing. The surrounding area is really cute so we walked around a little bit before it was time to get seated. Its a super cute place for brunch, worth it to get a teensy bit dressed up to enjoy yourselfI had the corned beef hash. The portions were HUGE and the meat was very well seasoned. It wasn't too salty and the bread you get is super tasty as well. I recommend this dish but I also heard the french toast is really good if you want to go the sweet route. I'll be getting that next time.parking is very limited because the area is more like a quaint downtown"
1102,"The staff is very friendly and attentive. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside, but luckily there was a table or 2 open when I got there. I ordered the SHRIMP TACOS (two organic corn tortilla, marinated black tiger prawns, white cheddar cheese, Red Chile avocado crema, fresh mangos, served with house black beans & pico de gallo). They should include their house salsa on the side, but they did not so I asked for some green sauce and it went well with the tacos. The black beans have a lot of flavor to them too. The tacos are great, but for $13.95, it is quite overpriced imo. Great tacos none-the-less! Would come here again, not sure how often, but I'll be back for some more tacos :)"
1103,"Came here on a Saturday morning with the bf around 9am (they opened at 8). Surprisingly it was not that packed. Free, small parking lot in front and I think they have some free street parking also. We ordered 2 items: Delmar Crepe (baby spinach, crab cakes, caramelized onions, fontina cheese & red chili avocado creme, hollandaise sauce on top) $15.95Chicken Pesto Crepe (mushroom, tomato, gruyere cheese, marinated chicken breast, pesto) $13.50The crab cake crepe was really good and rich in flavor. It might be too heavy for some people but I liked it. The pesto crepe was more subtle; it was good too. Both went well with the thin, crispy breakfast potatoes (I add ketchup + tabasco sauce). I've also had the crab cake benedict and chocolate chip pancakes in the past and they are pretty tasty also. Good service and food."
1104,"Stephanie S., Sing W., and I decided to get brunch before a sake tasting event, so we headed over to Bette's Oceanview Diner. With over 1.6K reviews on Yelp, it's no wonder this place had a huge line! (The diner is also very small, so the turnover rate is pretty low.) I was really looking forward to eating their popular souffle pancake, but after seeing how we'd have to wait 40+ minutes, we wandered over to Cafe M, which is just a block away. I really liked their high ceilings and kitchen decor.- Salmon Florentine Benedict ($16.95): a heart meal with yummy salmon and spinach! It also comes with a side of potatoes.- Aztec Huevos Rancheros ($14.95): Sing ordered this and it smelled amazing! She liked that it was delicious and healthy at the same time.- Banana Stuffed French Toast ($12.95): Everyone raved about this on Yelp, so I had to get it! Although it was filling and perfectly sweet, I didn't think it lived up to its hype. I just wasn't fully satisfied with it!Although this breakfast spot was popular (probably from the overflow of Bette's), it was definitely not as packed. The hostess wasn't great at estimating wait times - we waited 3x longer than she estimated... which made us regret not just going back to Bette's since we waited basically the same amount of time. There were many empty tables vs a group of people waiting to be seated. Our water cups were never refilled, and it took forever to flag someone down to get our orders. Overall? Although service was lacking, the food was decently good."
1105,"An all-day brunch spot in the bougie 4th Street shopping district, but not bougie prices. Delicious food, great coffee/espresso, and quick service. They're always pretty busy, but you usually don't need to wait long for a table. They have lots of eggs benny options (I LOVE the blackstone - bacon and grilled tomatoes), omelettes, pancakes, burritos, French toast, and crepes...but there are also some lunch options, like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well. They have boozy brunch beverages, too!Be sure to check out their specials on the blackboard when you first come in - they have some great seasonal goodies (their pumpkin pancakes in the fall are EXCELLENT!!)."
1106,"It was a Saturday morning, which means a perfect time for brunch, especially since i'm a visitor to the area. After debating on several options in the area, the cousins and I decided on this restaurant for our meal. PARKING + AMBIENCEThere is a two hour limit parking lot area for customers of the businesses in the vicinity. You can also find street parking around the neighborhood, although it was packed with cars bumper to bumper when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating outdoors and indoors. It was a sunny day, so the restaurant was oozing with light and an enjoyable atmosphere. FOODThe portions are gigantic, their entrees are shareable between two people. I got the DelMar Crepe and barely managed to finish it, I was absolutely stuffed after. The DelMar Crepe ($15.95) is topped with hollandaise sauce with a filling of crab cakes, spinach, red chili avocado creme, fontina cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavors were savory in my mouth, I liked the addition of the crab cakes, which made for a unique crepe! A side of breakfast potatoes is included in the dish. In addition, their selection of hot sauce is a plus. I used two different hot sauce for my potatoes and crepe and they both hit the spot. The extra hot flavoring  made the an already delicious meal even better. SERVICEWe were luckily seated immediately when we arrived because there were plenty of people already dining away. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, she was personable and made nice small talk. CONCLUSIONCafe M is great, I recommend them for anyone looking for brunch in the Berkeley area. Everything on the dish was delicious, from the crepe to the potatoes, this is a classic brunch dish with a bit of unique ingredients. Cafe M serves all the traditional brunch items, so you can choose from your favorites. They met our expectations and then some, definitely a spot I would return to."
1107,"Cafe M is a fantastic brunch place, especially as they are one of the few brunch places in the area that offers bottomless mimosas. Sadly, since my latest visit today, they have increased the price to $21 and are putting a limit of 5 glasses per person. Not quite bottomless anymore, but their glasses are quite big and I never drink more than 3. Still gets me tipsy!I've always enjoyed their food; today I ordered their Del Mar crepe while my friend ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It seems to me they've changed from using the English muffin to using country sour levain bread (I don't recall them using the latter in previous visits) but it was still good, according to my friend. I really enjoyed the Del Mar crepe and the thinly cut and crispy potatoes. I did think that the potatoes weren't salted enough for me but some use of Tapatio on the side did the trick. Solid 4/5- reliable brunch in Berkeley."
1108,"By far passed my expectations when I visited this place in Berkeley. Street parking was a little bit difficult, but other than that I was able to be seated right away. I ordered French toast which was absolutely mouth watering! The cinnamon butter which was on top of the battered Hawaiian roll made the dish. Their potatoes, eggs, and bacon were all cooked to perfection. And the vanilla latte was the icing on the cake. Not only was the graphic well done, but the drink itself was perfect to wash down my meal. I can see this being a perfect place to be during the fall/autumn when you're looking for a nice warm meal. I'll be back soon."
1109,Pretty good breakfast option in the area! We ordered their Crabcake Benedict and Irish Benedict and both were pretty good. The portions were pretty big. Coffee was good too and they refilled my cup before I was dry... which is always a plus. No problems in the service dept. I would be back if I was in the area!
1110,- Solid brunch food. - Price per plate seems like a lot but you are getting a boatload of food. Everyone at my table either gave up or took the last bite and collapsed.- No wait for 3 on a Saturday morning around 11. - The potatoes served on the side are for every hash-lover's dream to try something new but not sacrifice crunchy creamy carbsI got the eggs Blackstone and a single blueberry pancakes. Blackstone is like Benedict but with bacon (my favorite) instead of ham. The bacon comes chopped pieces the size of a dime. It's topped with perfectly poached eggs and a creamy hollandaise. What else is unique is that they serve it on top of levain (think crusty) toast instead of English muffins. Fine by me. The potato's served on the side are killer. Finally the pancake was fresh home-tasting goodness but really nothing special.
1111,"Brunch was great.  Aside from having to remake my eggs poached hard, it was really good.  Will definitely revisit!"
1112,"Not sure I'm quite the fan as most people who've reviewed here. The hostess wasn't very friendly, her affect was actually a little off putting and at first I took it personally, but as we were waiting for a table realized that she was the same toward everyone. Our server was great, super attentive, made some recommendations and checked on us regularly. But the food was very average. I'd probably come back for the bottomless mimosas and a basic brunch experience, but unfortunately, there's nothing to rave about."
1113,"This was a quaint eatery in the middle of a shopping area in Berkeley. There are other great brunch choices, like Bette's Oceanview Diner, but if you want tasty, comfort food with some south-of-the-border flair, Café M's your best bet.We went around 9 a.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait. But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"

But, more tables were filled by the time we left the café. I loved the cozy, homey feeling of Café M, and the food was delicious. Everything has a bit of spice to it and is very, very flavorful. Highly recommended! Our server seemed busy during the time of our visit (I had to constantly ask for water refills, extra napkins, etc.) but she was cheerful and gave good recommendations. My friend and I were completely satisfied with our brunch choices. Here's what we got:""Delmar Crepe"": I was torn between this entrée and the crab cakes eggs benedict, but since I had ordered an eggs benedict for breakfast the day before, I opted for something different. Now, normally I don't really go for crepes when it comes to brunch ... I'd much rather have benedicts. But I was craving crabmeat more than anything else, and since the ingredients in this crepe sounded promising, I decided to give it a try ... and boy, I'm glad I did. This crepe featured crab cakes, baby spinach, red chili avocado crème, fontina cheese and caramelized onions. It was topped with hollandaise sauce and served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes here are very different from traditional roasted potatoes. Instead, they're thinly sliced--almost scalloped--and are crispy and crunchy. Definitely different, and as much as I love soft, chewy potatoes, I embraced the difference. ""Berkeley Hill's"": This scrambler came with Italian sausage, spinach, green onions, mushrooms and fontina cheese. It came served atop a mound of those crispy potatoes. My friend was pleased with her scrambler - it was definitely tasty. I tried a bite and relished the savory sausage chunks and I loved the ooey, gooey fontina cheese. But I think my friend was more excited about the potatoes than anything else. Crispy, scalloped potatoes are her fav so she was happy that this café's potatoes were different from the norm. The portions are really generous for brunch, so she ended up taking half of her meal (and my extra potatoes) home. ""Chicken Pesto Crèpe"": This was another brunch selection that I wouldn't mind trying one day. It features marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, pesto and gruyere cheese; it's also served with breakfast potatoes. I almost ordered it during this brunch trip, except I really wanted the crab cakes. If I ever ordered this crepe, though, I would just get it sans tomatoes. Pesto is one of my favorite spreads, so I look forward to trying this one day. ""Crab Cake Benedict"": It seems that this eggs benny is one of the more popular brunch options, and since I love crab cakes, I do want to order it in the future. This dish comprises fresh crab meat with aioli, scallions and bell peppers, and it's lightly crusted with panko. All eggs benedicts are served over toasted country sour levain bread with poached eggs, hollandaise and grilled potatoes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes in the crepe, so I'm sure I would love it in eggs benny form as well. The only part I'm slightly concerned about are the scallions and bell peppers--I don't especially love bell peppers--but I'm sure they give the crab cakes some extra spice. I also anticipate trying that levain bread ... yum!"
1134,"I wanted to check out the 4th Street Shops to kick off our weekend trip so Cafe M looked like a popular brunch spot. I was worried it would be busy since it was Saturday but we were seated right away, and we were in and out in about a half hour! The service was good and the food came out super fast. We went with their top two - stuffed French toast and crab benedict. My crab benedict was very flavorful and the hollandaise and poached eggs added even more to the dish. It was served on top of toasted sourdough which was too crunchy for my liking, even with the egg yolk and aioli, so I didn't get to eat that part. I did enjoy their thinly sliced potatoes which were different than the usual cubes. Although food tasted good and service was efficient, I'm still giving it a 4-star. I don't think it was worth the $30 price tag for the amount of food we got."
1135,"The service was impeccable! Our waiter was really nice and definitely offered suggestions when we asked. In addition, he made sure to make us feel like we were honored guests at cafe M! Unfortunately for me, I ordered the chicken pesto crepe with no mushrooms because I have a strong dislike for them. They messed up my order! Luckily, I'm not allergic to mushrooms! If it weren't for the time crunch my group and I were in, I would have asked if it was ok to have my order fixed. The food was decent. Definitely matched the pricing. I'll have to come by again to give a more definitely rating, where my order is right!"
1136,"I'm a fan because you'll always find parking (either street or in the lot) and the food itself is wonderful. Even though there's a line during popular hours, you'll find that it goes by pretty quickly. Not to mention, it's located on 4th street and there's tons to do and explore while you wait. Great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or even have a ""me"" day."
1137,"I came to Cafe M 4 years ago when I was in college and I had the best crab cake benedict EVER here. I came back today to have it again and it is still delicious! It is a bit different though because they've changed their bread and I do think it was better before. Besides that the side of thinly sliced potatoes is delicious!Service wise, it was great. Even though they were packed on a Saturday for brunch, we didn't have to wait very long and the food came out quickly too. Parking wise there is a free parking lot (first 2 hours free) right next to the cafe. I'll be back but next time I'm going to try the French toast, which they make with Hawaiian bread!"
1138,"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if I could. I've been to Cafe M multiple times in the past and I've always encountered good food and good service. However, more recently they changed up their menu and cut out many of their vegetarian options. **I'm a strict vegetarian.** There is no vegetarian crepe or sandwich listed on their menu any longer and this cuts down on my options quite a bit. Frankly, this brought down my rating from a 4.0 to a 3.5. That said, their pancakes and french toast are still great. My only qualm is that they have a side of potatoes for $4; the portion and the flavor are really not worth $4. Overall, Cafe M is a great alternative for other breakfast/brunch places in the area, especially if you want to avoid the 1.5 hr wait times at Bette's."
1139,"Stopped by for some breakfast on a Monday morning. It wasn't as busy as I expected since it was a rainy day and all. I ordered the crab cakes benedict and I loved the potatoes. It was different to have their potatoes thinly sliced and crispy compared to the usual chopped chunks or potatoes or a large chunk of hash browns. I would definitely come back just for that.For the crab cakes, it was very plain and very soggy since I'm used to crispy crab cakes. The toast was also very hard and tasted like plastic. I would not recommend that. I would give this place another try if I'm in the area but so far seems like their dishes are a hit or miss. Portions are generous though and service was good."
