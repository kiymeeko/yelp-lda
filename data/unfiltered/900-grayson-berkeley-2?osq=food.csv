0,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
2,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
3,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
4,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
5,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
6,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
7,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
8,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
9,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
10,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
11,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
12,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
13,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
14,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
15,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
16,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
17,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
18,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
19,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"

33,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
34,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
35,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
36,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
37,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
38,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
39,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
40,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
41,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
42,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
43,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
44,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
45,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
46,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
47,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
48,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
49,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
50,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
51,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
52,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.

This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
65,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
66,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
67,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
68,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
69,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
70,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
71,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
72,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
73,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
74,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
75,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
76,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
77,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
78,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
79,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
80,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
81,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
82,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
83,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright

Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
95,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
96,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
97,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
98,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
99,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
100,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
101,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
102,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
103,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
104,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
105,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
106,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
107,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
108,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
109,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
110,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
111,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
112,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
113,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
114,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers.

One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
128,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
129,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
130,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
131,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
132,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
133,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
134,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
135,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
136,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
137,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
138,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
139,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
140,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
141,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
142,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
143,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
144,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
145,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
146,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"

159,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
160,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
161,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
162,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
163,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
164,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
165,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
166,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
167,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
168,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
169,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
170,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
171,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
172,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
173,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
174,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
175,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
176,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
177,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
178,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
191,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
192,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
193,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
194,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
195,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
196,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
197,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
198,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
199,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
200,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
201,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
202,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
203,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
204,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
205,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
206,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
207,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
208,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
209,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
210,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!!

I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
222,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
223,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
224,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
225,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
226,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
227,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
228,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
229,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
230,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
231,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
232,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
233,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
234,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
235,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
236,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
237,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
238,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
239,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
240,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"

With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
254,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
255,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
256,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
257,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
258,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
259,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
260,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
261,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
262,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
263,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
264,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
265,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
266,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
267,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
268,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
269,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
270,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
271,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
272,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
273,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed.

Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
285,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
286,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
287,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
288,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
289,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
290,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
291,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
292,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
293,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
294,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
295,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
296,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
297,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
298,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
299,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
300,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
301,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
302,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
303,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
304,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner.

This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
315,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
316,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
317,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
318,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
319,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
320,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
321,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
322,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
323,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
324,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
325,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
326,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
327,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
328,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
329,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
330,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
331,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
332,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
333,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
334,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly.

Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
348,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
349,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
350,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
351,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
352,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
353,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
354,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
355,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
356,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
357,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
358,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
359,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
360,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
361,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
362,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
363,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
364,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
365,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
366,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"

379,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
380,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
381,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
382,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
383,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
384,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
385,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
386,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
387,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
388,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
389,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
390,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
391,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
392,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
393,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
394,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
395,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
396,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
397,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
398,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
411,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
412,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
413,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
414,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
415,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
416,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
417,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
418,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
419,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
420,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
421,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
422,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
423,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
424,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
425,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
426,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
427,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
428,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
429,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
430,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!!

I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
442,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
443,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
444,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
445,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
446,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
447,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
448,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
449,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
450,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
451,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
452,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
453,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
454,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
455,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
456,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
457,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
458,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
459,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
460,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"

With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
474,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
475,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
476,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
477,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
478,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
479,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
480,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
481,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
482,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
483,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
484,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
485,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
486,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
487,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
488,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
489,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
490,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
491,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
492,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
493,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed.

Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
505,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
506,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
507,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
508,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
509,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
510,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
511,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
512,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
513,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
514,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
515,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
516,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
517,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
518,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
519,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
520,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
521,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
522,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
523,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
524,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner.

This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
535,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
536,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
537,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
538,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
539,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
540,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
541,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
542,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
543,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
544,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
545,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
546,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
547,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
548,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
549,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
550,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
551,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
552,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
553,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
554,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly.

Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
568,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
569,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
570,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
571,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
572,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
573,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
574,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
575,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
576,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
577,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
578,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
579,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
580,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
581,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
582,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
583,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
584,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
585,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
586,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"

599,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
600,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
601,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
602,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
603,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
604,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
605,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
606,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
607,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
608,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
609,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
610,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
611,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
612,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
613,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
614,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
615,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
616,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
617,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
618,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
631,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
632,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
633,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
634,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
635,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
636,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
637,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
638,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
639,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
640,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
641,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
642,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
643,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
644,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
645,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
646,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
647,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
648,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
649,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
650,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!!

I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
662,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
663,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
664,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
665,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
666,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
667,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
668,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
669,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
670,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
671,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
672,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
673,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
674,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
675,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
676,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
677,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
678,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
679,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
680,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"

With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
694,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
695,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
696,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
697,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
698,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
699,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
700,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
701,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
702,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
703,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
704,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
705,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
706,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
707,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
708,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
709,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
710,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
711,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
712,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
713,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed.

Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
725,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
726,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
727,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
728,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
729,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
730,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
731,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
732,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
733,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
734,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
735,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
736,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
737,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
738,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
739,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
740,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
741,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
742,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
743,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
744,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner.

This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
755,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
756,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
757,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
758,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
759,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
760,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
761,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
762,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
763,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
764,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
765,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
766,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
767,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
768,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
769,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
770,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
771,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
772,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
773,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
774,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly.

Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
788,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
789,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
790,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
791,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
792,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
793,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
794,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
795,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
796,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
797,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
798,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
799,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
800,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
801,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
802,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
803,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
804,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
805,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
806,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"

819,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
820,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
821,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
822,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
823,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
824,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
825,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
826,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
827,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
828,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
829,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
830,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
831,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
832,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
833,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
834,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
835,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
836,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
837,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
838,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
851,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
852,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
853,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
854,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
855,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
856,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
857,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
858,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
859,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
860,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
861,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
862,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
863,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
864,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
865,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
866,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
867,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
868,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
869,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
870,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!!

I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
882,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
883,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
884,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
885,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
886,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
887,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
888,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
889,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
890,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
891,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
892,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
893,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
894,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
895,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
896,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
897,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
898,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
899,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
900,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"

With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
914,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
915,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
916,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
917,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
918,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
919,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
920,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
921,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
922,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
923,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
924,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
925,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
926,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
927,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
928,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
929,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
930,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
931,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
932,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
933,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed.

Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
945,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
946,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
947,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
948,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
949,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
950,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
951,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
952,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
953,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
954,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
955,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
956,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
957,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
958,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
959,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
960,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
961,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
962,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
963,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
964,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner.

This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
975,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
976,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
977,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
978,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
979,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
980,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
981,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
982,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
983,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
984,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
985,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
986,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
987,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
988,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
989,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
990,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
991,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
992,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
993,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
994,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly.

Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1008,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1009,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1010,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1011,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1012,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1013,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1014,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1015,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1016,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1017,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1018,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1019,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1020,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1021,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1022,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1023,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1024,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1025,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1026,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"

1039,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1040,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1041,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1042,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1043,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1044,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1045,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1046,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1047,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1048,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1049,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1050,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1051,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1052,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1053,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1054,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1055,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1056,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1057,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1058,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1071,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1072,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1073,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1074,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1075,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1076,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1077,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1078,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1079,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1080,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1081,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1082,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1083,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1084,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1085,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1086,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1087,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1088,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1089,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1090,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe.

The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1101,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1102,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1103,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1104,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1105,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1106,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1107,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1108,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1109,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1110,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1111,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1112,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1113,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1114,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1115,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1116,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1117,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1118,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1119,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1120,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can.

The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1134,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1135,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1136,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1137,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1138,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1139,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1140,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1141,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1142,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1143,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1144,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1145,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1146,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1147,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1148,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1149,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1150,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1151,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1152,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.

I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1165,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1166,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1167,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1168,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1169,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1170,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1171,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1172,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1173,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1174,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1175,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1176,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1177,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1178,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1179,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1180,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1181,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1182,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"

The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1195,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1196,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1197,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1198,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1199,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1200,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1201,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1202,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1203,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1204,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1205,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1206,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1207,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1208,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1209,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1210,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1211,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1212,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1213,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1214,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat.

I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1227,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1228,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1229,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1230,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1231,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1232,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1233,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1234,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1235,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1236,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1237,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1238,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1239,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1240,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1241,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1242,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1243,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1244,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1245,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.

This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1258,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1259,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1260,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1261,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1262,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1263,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1264,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1265,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1266,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1267,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1268,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1269,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1270,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1271,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1272,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1273,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1274,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1275,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1276,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1277,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery.

1290,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1291,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1292,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1293,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1294,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1295,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1296,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1297,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1298,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1299,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1300,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1301,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1302,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1303,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1304,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1305,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1306,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1307,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1308,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1309,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.

Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1321,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1322,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1323,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1324,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1325,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1326,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1327,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1328,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1329,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1330,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1331,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1332,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1333,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1334,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1335,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1336,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1337,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1338,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."

At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1351,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1352,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1353,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1354,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1355,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1356,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1357,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1358,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1359,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1360,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1361,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1362,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1363,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1364,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1365,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1366,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1367,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1368,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1369,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1370,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!!

I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1382,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1383,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1384,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1385,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1386,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1387,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1388,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1389,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1390,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1391,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1392,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1393,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1394,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1395,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1396,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1397,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1398,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1399,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1400,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"

I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1414,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1415,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1416,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1417,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1418,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1419,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1420,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1421,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1422,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1423,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1424,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1425,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1426,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1427,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1428,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1429,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1430,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1431,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1432,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1433,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover.

Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1445,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1446,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1447,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1448,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1449,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1450,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1451,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1452,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1453,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1454,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1455,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1456,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1457,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1458,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1459,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1460,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1461,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1462,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1463,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1464,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"".

Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1475,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1476,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1477,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1478,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1479,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1480,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1481,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1482,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1483,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1484,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1485,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1486,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1487,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1488,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1489,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1490,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1491,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1492,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1493,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1494,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion?

I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1507,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1508,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1509,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1510,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1511,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1512,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1513,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1514,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1515,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1516,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1517,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1518,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1519,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1520,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1521,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1522,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1523,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1524,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1525,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1526,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed!

My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1539,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1540,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1541,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1542,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1543,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1544,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1545,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1546,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1547,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1548,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1549,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1550,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1551,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1552,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1553,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1554,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1555,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1556,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1557,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1558,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy.

Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1571,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1572,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1573,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1574,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1575,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1576,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1577,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1578,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1579,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1580,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1581,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1582,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1583,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1584,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1585,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1586,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1587,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1588,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1589,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.

I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1601,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1602,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1603,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1604,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1605,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1606,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1607,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1608,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1609,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1610,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1611,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1612,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1613,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1614,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1615,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1616,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1617,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1618,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1619,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1620,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles.

1632,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1633,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1634,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1635,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1636,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1637,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1638,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1639,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1640,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1641,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1642,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1643,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1644,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1645,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1646,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1647,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1648,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1649,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1650,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1651,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."

1663,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1664,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1665,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1666,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1667,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1668,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1669,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1670,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1671,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1672,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1673,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1674,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1675,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1676,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1677,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1678,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1679,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1680,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1681,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1682,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"

But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1695,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1696,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1697,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1698,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1699,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1700,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1701,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1702,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1703,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1704,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1705,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1706,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1707,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1708,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1709,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1710,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1711,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1712,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1713,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1714,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion.

Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1726,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1727,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1728,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1729,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1730,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1731,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1732,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1733,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1734,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1735,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1736,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
1737,"First off, the parking here is atrocious. If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1738,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1739,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1740,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1741,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1742,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1743,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1744,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1745,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries.

If you work near by or close enough to uber, you've got no problems.I came in on a busy morning by myself and took a seat at the window, the service was fast and amazing! I had already been greeted, seated with a nice cup of hot coffee, and my order was already taken with in the first minute I walked in. I have been here a few times and the service has always been consistent. I usually order the Demon's Lover which is their version of chicken and waffles. Usually served with either gravy or syrup, your choice; also seems to be their most popular item on the menu. Unfortunately there has been a bit of inconsistency with the quality of food lately, either they have started freezing their chicken or it was way over cooked cause one of the two cuts of chicken was rubbery. This is a good spot for breakfast if your close by, but not exactly worth the trip across the bridge for."
1758,"What's in the gravy that comes with the Demon Lovers plate? ... cause 'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaym, it's pretty good !' And that's saying a lot cause I really hate gravy. My dislike stems from way back as a child - my Mom would douse everything from meatloaf to salisbury steak in her homemade gravy. Don't get me wrong; I love my Mom but I've consumed enough gravy to last a lifetime! I would definitely go back for the Demon Lovers plate (aka Chicken & waffles) cause you won't get that gravy anywhere else! Plus they serve you with a warm & welcoming smile which is always nice."
1759,"A local restaurant that digs Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?  Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger... is there any way to get a side of Lee Pace as King Thranduil?Ahem.  Or maybe we'll just stick to their Saturday brunch menu.  This place was recommended by a former colleague, now friend, and I had a chance to catch up with him and his fiance one sunny Saturday morning.  After circling around a bit, I was able to snag a parking spot right across the street.  The place was absolutely packed, but the wait for a table of 3 was only about 15 minutes (not bad at all!).  Since it was such a nice day, we opted to sit outside in the small patio area.I wish I got our server's name so I could thank her for being so welcoming (my first time here!) and attentive without being overbearing/rushing us.  After some deliberation (a lot of the Saturday brunch menu items sound amazing), here's what we got:    breakfast - 10.50^ fresh farm eggs, apple wood smoked bacon or aidell's chicken apple sausage, hashed browns, acme levain toasttom boy - 11.50^ poached eggs, potato, apple & parsnip corned beef hash, acme white toastdemon lover - 14^ fried all natural chicken breast, buttermilk waffle, old-fashioned cram gravy or Vermont maple syrup ($2 extra for both)rickey - 3^ house made ginger syrup, pomegranate, lemonade & sparkling water 16 oz latte - 3.50 x 2I opted for the breakfast and latte and left feeling completely satiated and happy.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled; the chicken sausage was juicy; hashed browns had a golden brown, slightly crispy exterior with a soft interior; and the toast was warm and hearty, ready to be spread with butter and/or jam.  These are the slow, delicious mornings that make you wanna live for the weekend.  Well played, 900 Grayson, I will definitely be back!"
1760,"My friend requested to have brunch at this gem for her birthday. She's been wanting to take me here, since she understands my love for chicken and waffles. Upon arrival, it's first come first serve. You go up to the front and tell them how many people you have and put down your name. Since this place only really serves breakfast and lunch, they get really busy especially on Saturday's and Sunday's. The earlier you get there, the better. I forgot to mention that this restaurant is kind of small...Anyway, I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. It came with a huge waffle and 2 chicken wings or chicken breasts... The chicken is crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside! They also add this sauce, it's kinda like a gravy but it has a spice to it! That sauce went really well with the chicken, The plate had sweet, salty and spicy! The service wasn't that bad, they're just really busy and trying to work as fast as they can. The server forgot a few things that we asked for on the side, but it's no biggie.I have yet to re-visit this restaurant, but I'll be going back soon to get my chicken and waffle fix!"
1761,"I really wanted this place to blow me away....but what a let down. I was pretty disappointed by the mediocrity of flavor. Their waffles tasted like straight up wheat. Where's the sugar? I've had wheat waffles before and they were divine...these not so much. I myself went with the ""breakfast"" entree which consisted of hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon. Can't really go wrong there. My friends however all decided to step out and try something different, only to be  left feeling robbed in the taste department. The batter for the chicken was made with buttermilk I believe. That usually denotes deliciousness coming your way, but that wasn't the case here. I was told the chicken wasn't bad, but it also was not anything to ride home about. If you're going to have C&W on the menu, you have got to do it right and SEASON that joint. On the bright said, the guy who I believe was the manager, was pretty cool. He got folks in and out like a pro. When he said the wait was only 20 min- he was right on the money every time. Folks seemed to have a shared sense of ""not lingering"" so others could get in and enjoy food too, which was nice. All in all, I'm used to a little salt in my food, so maybe this just wasn't the spot to get it. Then again, this was a place in Berkeley with Chicken and Waffles on the menu...#EnoughSaid"
1762,"Always a great place to introduce your friends to. The restaurant is not what you would expect; It's quaint, cozy and has a small-town, farm house atmosphere that makes it unique, given that it is located in Oakland. The wait isn't too long, and the service is very receptive and warm.This place is famous for its chicken and waffles, so we both ordered the Demon Lover. The waffle is soft, and the chicken is lightly battered. I usually feel bloated after eating fried chicken, but its as light as fried chicken can get; It was a bit dry though. Very filling portions. The best part was the delicious gravy and maple syrup. Would recommend getting one of each and splitting the two with a friend, as getting both is an additional $2. The hours are a bit restricting, I believe it closes at 3 PM so go early!"
1763,The chicken and waffles were so underwhelming.My waffle was burnt and asked for a new one then they brought a undercooked waffleThe chicken was alright
1764,"Okay, Roscoe's go ahead and eat your heart out. This generation from the year 2000 and onwards have been noted to fall in love with the sweet and savory Taste of chicken and waffles. I don't know exactly why but the combination works. And Grayson 900 knows exactly how I feel about it. This is a place that I bookmarked a while back but just never got a chance to go to until recently, has famed a novelty breakfast package....Known to the faint of heart as ""The Demon Lover"". I personally, do not know why it's called that yet I cannot lie and it's probably one of the best combination of food I've ever had. Buttermilk gravy and a warm syrup with a great cup of coffee and made my day so much better that it has been lately.The place itself is a quaint beautiful small hole-in-the-wall Diner. Limited parking, if you're in the neighborhood and just enough seeding to be romantically aesthetic personal and casual without being anything else but Charming. Be smart and make sure that you check out when the breakfast and lunch times are. They have a limited times when the exact spot is actually open. I just so happen to get there right before breakfast was about to be over and they're about to close. I personally hate waiting for tables.I often eat alone, so I can take in the ambience  and entertainment of the cool decor and art work on the wall, at the time it featured a cool picture of Bruce lee and a naked chick. And I also noticed that they had merchandise for sale with the Demon Lover on it as a T-shirt for thier fame. The place is an overall great service to the community and to my stomach! Hopefully I can get a chance to visit one more time and another time after that and another time and so on, continue rocking on grayson!"
1765,Visited 900 Grayson for my second visit a couple days ago. Believe I missed the main breakfast rush since my party of three was seated immediately. Good stuff because this restaurant is rather small and gets busy! After browsing the menu I quickly learned we missed the breakfast menu by about 15 minutes. Darn! The manager/waiter was working the line while also taking orders from the front tables. This is a little annoying since it is hard to grab someone's attention when they're running all over the place. With a little patience we got our order in. Decided on the fried chicken breast and waffle. Both the chicken and waffle were hot and crispy. I was happy about the fried chicken breast as it eliminates the need to maneuver around bones. Also ordered a side of french fries. Those were not the best and taste like they had been sitting around a short time. I'm not always on the Berkeley side so it's always a treat when I'm able to stop by for a quick bite. Sprinkles on top when I don't have to stand around for a table. They really need some more help on the service front. I feel like I inconvenience the staff when I have to ask for something. It should never be that way.
1766,"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles!This was my first time having the much-heard-of chicken and waffles, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, but there was no grease and a nice crunch to the skin. I came here for brunch with some friends last Saturday morning. We got to sit on the patio, which was nice and surprisingly spacious!I tried the bf's cheesy grits. OMG my life was changed! I've had regular grits before and was never really impressed with why people would ever eat it. However, this is a must-try! I actually enjoyed the grits with my fried chicken, rather than the gravy that came with my dish.I can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
1767,"Soooo....... One of my friends decided to take me here because she claimed that they have ""bomb chicken and waffles"" and I thought great another hipster joint making fried chicken .Once I got there I obviously ordered the chicken and waffles (I forgot the fancy name they use for the dish) with gravy and syrup. Even though the chicken was boneless, it was fried perfectly and it had a good crunch. The gravy  definitely gave the dish that extra umph that it needed. The waffle was along the lines of a wheat waffle (not sure if I'm right on this), but overall it was really good.This place is totally worth the hype!"
1768,"I recently had late breakfast with a friend on a weekday. I was immediately impressed with how quickly we were seated, despite appearing very full. Food came quickly and overall it was delicious. My friend had the corned beef hash, and I had the chicken and waffle. I honestly cannot remember the clever menu names for these dishes. Food wise my complaints are small. My fried chicken had a delicious batter and it was well fried. My problem is that the meat itself did not appeared to be seasoned, and it was an uninspired piece of breast tender. I realize this is to facilitate easy eating, but it really is a poorer flavor choice. My waffle was a bit soft and deflated as well. They choose a traditional American style waffle instead of Belgian, and I have no qualms with that choice. But I'm fairly certain it had been pre-cooked and stored under heat. No waffle appreciates that treatment. I was very pleased with the accompanying gravy."
1769,My friend and I had just finished climbing and were looking for a bite to eat. I didnt realize how close 900 Grayson was to ironworks until I checked ! We were so lucky to go on a weekday because there was no line and we were seated right away.  The restaurant is small and cozy a la berkeley style.  I ordered the chicken with gravy and syrup.  You must get the gravy and syrup!! The gravy here is sooo creamy and savory. They use real maple syrup here which tastes so much better compared to those nasty hcfs stuff at ihop. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful inside I didnt even really need any sauce.  I highly recommend if you are in berkeley on a weekday morning to come check 900 Grayson out !! Cant wait to check out their other dishes.
1770,"It's sad to say that I had to rewrite a review after my great experience last time of a 5, so after today's experience of probably a 2- it's an average of 3.5 stars.We had to run some errands in berkeley, so since were in the area, I convinced my boyfriend to go here (he wasn't a fan his first time either). Luckily, it wasn't that busy because he hates to wait. I ordered my usual the demon lover and he ordered the burger. We also asked for water. After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for water again. We assumed they forgot- it happens. Then 10 minutes later we had to ask AGAIN!! They brought us 2 small glasses and a small carafe. The carafe basically filled both our small cups with a little left for maybe half another glass, so we emptied it. One of the guys took our empty carafe. We thought he was refilling it, but noooo that wasn't the case. It never came back.Cant believe we waited 40 minutes before our food came!!! What took me off the edge was that another table, who were seated AFTER WE ORDERED, got their demon lover before we did. At this point I know I looked aggrevated, but no one ever checked up on us or uodated us on our food. Instead, we had to ask for water AGAIN, which for some reason was so hard to get. The chicken was not crispy today, it was a little dry, so I had to drench it in sauce. Good thing the sauces were good as usual. The burger was also a little dry eventhough we got it medium. It could've been because we asked for bbq sauce on the side. That was also a better idea because we didn't even like the bbq sauce. It had a strange sour taste to it (not like we are use to). Then to top it off, the fries were oily and soggy.We didn't end up getting a refill on water until we were basically done eating because we asked for the bill and WATER at the same time. I was SOOO DISAPPOINTED! Not only was the service bad, but the food did not do any justice either. We paid and left.On the way out my boyfriend said, ""It's confirmed, we are not coming back here anymore. I still feel the same way, food is mehh."" That's coming from someone who tried it once, and gave it another chance. I've been here several times. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mehh, but unfortunately, I think the bad has outweighed the good."
1771,"I haven't been here in at least a decade, and I'm happy to say they haven't lost a step in that time. I experienced really fast, helpful service here throughout, and the food was excellent. Figured I could slip in here on a Friday morning to a quiet room, but I was mistaken -- the place was fully seated and bustling, with a few parties waiting for tables. It was nice of them to seat me quickly at a table for two, especially when they could have relegated me to the counter (which would have suited me fine, btw). I ordered the full breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Acme white toast, all of which was done to perfection. I'm a sucker for hash browns, and these were pleasingly crisp without being greasy, and creamy on the inside."
1772,Service was pretty good. Chicken sandwich was awesome with the addition of a little hot sauce.  Would go back for sure.
1773,"We woke up early and headed to 900 Grayson for breakfast. A few other tables were already occupied and we picked a two top at the back of the restaurant. The waitress handed me the menu and I was initially disappointed by the lack of selection with only 7 items; most of which were extremely unenticing to me (7th and Grayson's description lost me with the first two words: organic tofu). He wanted the Demon Lover and the only other option that sounded even remotely interesting was the Tom Boy (Poached Eggs, Corned Beef Hash, Toast). After deliberating, we both ended up with the Demon Lover. I had very little confidence in our selection since I've had many bad chicken and waffle meals before and we had an extensive discussion that morning about how we both do not like chicken breast.When the plates came out, I was very impressed. With the gravy poured over the chicken and waffles, the flavor was just right. The chicken was thin and tender; not dry and chewy the way I often find chicken breast. I usually don't like super soft waffles but it worked well with this chicken.I devoured everything on my dish very quickly and then reached across the table to grab some of his. The breakfast was so satisfying."
1774,"900 Grayson is totally run by a bunch of nerds. Takes one to know one you know? They have this thing called a Hobbit lunch with Tolkien-themed food fare such as Middle-Earth Salad, Arkenstone Soup, the Gandalf Burger, and a tuna steak known as The Gollum. But rest assured, despite the Lord of the Rings fanaticism, this restaurant is all about the food. And by the way, their portions are definitely not hobbit-sized. That's what Frodo said. 900 Grayson is a breakfast, brunch, and lunch place for now. Per their website ""dinner service will be offered at a later date"" but I read somewhere that since they are in a mixed-use commercial and residential area, the Orc-like residents nearby and the Goblins at the Berkeley Planning Department did not approve. Guess you can't say ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"", just yet. Now the only reason I come here is for ""my precious"" chicken and waffles that they call the Demon Lover. Again, I have no idea why they call this the Demon Lover because there is nothing demonic about it other than it being devilishly tasty. Maybe it's so good that Sméagol would approve? And despite it being covered in a spicy buttermilk batter, it's not like it will cause your eye of Sauron to burn 3 hours later.I swear, when I first had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's growing up as a kid in 1980s Los Angeles, I thought wow, this is some innovative fusion. Sweet and savory. Mmm! Mmm! Since then, it seems like everyone has jumped on the chicken and waffles gravy train from fancy pants Bouchon by Thomas Keller to low-budget IHOP. But I must say 900 Grayson's take is the best in the East Bay... ahem, Northern California. Now the Demon Lover consists of natural chicken paillard. Paillard is just a French-term that sounds ostensibly fancier than it is. It just means meat that is pounded flat. The thin chicken is then crusted with a delicious spicy buttermilk batter and it is served with a buttermilk waffle with your choice of old-fashioned gravy or Vermont maple syrup. For $2 more you can pimp your Demon Lover like a BO$$ by getting both the really creamy gravy and sweet maple syrup. I highly recommend you do this to get the best oralgasm taste sensation in your mouth. Due to its popularity, 900 Grayson can become a cluster-frodo, especially on Saturdays. My suggestion? Call ahead and order take-out. Then drive 5 minutes due north to the dog- and people-friendly Fieldwork Brewing Company and knock the Demon Lover back with some awesome beers. You can thank me later. 5 Stars despite the following cons:* There is an outdoor patio, but sadly, it is not dog-friendly. This is because you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the patio.* Parking is harder to find than Frodo finding the ring. * Limited hours: M-F - 8 AM to 3 PM (Closed for 1-hour between 10:30 to 11:30); Saturday - 8 AM to 2:30 PM; Sunday - Closed."
1775,"A surprisingly good find in what's otherwise a nondescript residential and light commercial/industrial area, 900 Grayson occupies a modest storefront and has a homey feel both inside, as well as outside on their back patio. Indeed, it's next door to several homes, so it's literally like dining in someone's back yard.A good choice for both brunch or lunch is anything involving fried chicken, whether their Demon Lover for brunch (fried chicken with buttermilk waffle and maple syrup) or their fried chicken sandwich for lunch. The chicken isn't only satisfying, but it's also fried and breaded just the right way. Service can be a bit leisurely and disinterested, but the advantage of this is that you'll be left alone if you're meeting someone for some private conversation. Thanks Yelpers for another good find!"
1776,"Arguably the best chicken and waffles I've had. I love the fact that the chicken is boneless too and very crispy. The gravy is heaven. You can also add some syrup to top things off, and break off an over easy egg, mix everything, and just enjoy 20 mins of pure happiness eating :) oh and they have outside seating too in the back"
