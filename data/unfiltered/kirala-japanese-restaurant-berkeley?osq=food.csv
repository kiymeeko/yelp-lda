0,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
2,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
3,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
4,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
5,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
6,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
7,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
8,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
9,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
10,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
11,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
12,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
13,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
14,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
15,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
16,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
17,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
18,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
19,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."

38,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
39,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
40,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
41,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
42,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
43,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
44,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
45,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
46,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
47,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
48,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
49,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
50,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
51,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
52,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
53,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
54,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
55,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
56,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
57,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
58,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO.

76,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
77,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
78,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
79,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
80,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
81,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
82,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
83,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
84,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
85,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
86,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
87,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
88,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
89,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
90,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
91,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
92,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
93,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
94,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
95,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."

They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
115,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
116,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
117,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
118,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
119,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
120,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
121,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
122,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
123,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
124,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
125,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
126,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
127,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
128,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
129,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
130,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
131,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
132,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
133,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
134,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant.

I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
154,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
155,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
156,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
157,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
158,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
159,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
160,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
161,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
162,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
163,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
164,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
165,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
166,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
167,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
168,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
169,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
170,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
171,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
172,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."

188,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
189,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
190,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
191,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
192,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
193,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
194,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
195,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
196,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
197,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
198,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
199,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
200,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
201,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
202,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
203,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
204,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
205,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
206,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
207,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"

Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
228,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
229,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
230,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
231,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
232,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
233,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
234,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
235,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
236,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
237,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
238,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
239,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
240,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
241,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
242,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
243,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
244,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
245,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
246,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
247,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference.

In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade.

I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds.

There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
266,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
267,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
268,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
269,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
270,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
271,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
272,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
273,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
274,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
275,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
276,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
277,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
278,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
279,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
280,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
281,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
282,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
283,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
284,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."

303,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
304,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
305,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
306,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
307,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
308,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
309,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
310,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
311,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
312,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
313,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
314,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
315,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
316,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
317,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
318,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
319,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
320,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
321,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
322,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
323,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance.

I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
341,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
342,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
343,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
344,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
345,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
346,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
347,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
348,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
349,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
350,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
351,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
352,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
353,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
354,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
355,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
356,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
357,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
358,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
359,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
360,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait.

377,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
378,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
379,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
380,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
381,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
382,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
383,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
384,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
385,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
386,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
387,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
388,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
389,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
390,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
391,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
392,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
393,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
394,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
395,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."

The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
415,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
416,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
417,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
418,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
419,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
420,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
421,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
422,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
423,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
424,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
425,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
426,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
427,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
428,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
429,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
430,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
431,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
432,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
433,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
434,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were.

I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
454,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
455,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
456,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
457,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
458,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
459,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
460,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
461,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
462,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
463,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
464,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
465,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
466,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
467,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
468,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
469,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
470,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
471,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
472,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."

488,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
489,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
490,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
491,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
492,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
493,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
494,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
495,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
496,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
497,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
498,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
499,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
500,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
501,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
502,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
503,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
504,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
505,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
506,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
507,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"

Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
528,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
529,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
530,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
531,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
532,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
533,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
534,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
535,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
536,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
537,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
538,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
539,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
540,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
541,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
542,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
543,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
544,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
545,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
546,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
547,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference.

In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade.

I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds.

There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
566,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
567,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
568,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
569,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
570,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
571,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
572,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
573,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
574,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
575,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
576,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
577,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
578,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
579,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
580,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
581,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
582,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
583,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
584,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."

603,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
604,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
605,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
606,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
607,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
608,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
609,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
610,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
611,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
612,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
613,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
614,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
615,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
616,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
617,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
618,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
619,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
620,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
621,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
622,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
623,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance.

I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
641,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
642,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
643,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
644,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
645,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
646,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
647,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
648,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
649,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
650,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
651,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
652,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
653,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
654,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
655,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
656,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
657,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
658,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
659,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
660,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait.

677,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
678,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
679,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
680,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
681,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
682,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
683,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
684,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
685,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
686,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
687,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
688,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
689,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
690,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
691,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
692,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
693,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
694,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
695,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."

The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
715,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
716,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
717,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
718,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
719,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
720,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
721,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
722,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
723,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
724,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
725,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
726,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
727,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
728,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
729,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
730,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
731,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
732,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
733,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
734,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were.

I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
754,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
755,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
756,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
757,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
758,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
759,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
760,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
761,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
762,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
763,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
764,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
765,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
766,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
767,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
768,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
769,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
770,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
771,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
772,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."

788,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
789,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
790,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
791,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
792,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
793,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
794,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
795,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
796,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
797,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
798,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
799,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
800,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
801,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
802,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
803,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
804,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
805,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
806,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
807,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"

Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
828,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
829,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
830,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
831,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
832,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
833,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
834,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
835,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
836,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
837,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
838,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
839,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
840,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
841,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
842,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
843,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
844,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
845,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
846,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
847,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference.

I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds.

There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
866,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
867,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
868,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
869,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
870,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
871,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
872,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
873,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
874,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
875,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
876,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
877,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
878,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
879,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
880,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
881,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
882,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
883,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
884,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."

903,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
904,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
905,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
906,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
907,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
908,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
909,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
910,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
911,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
912,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
913,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
914,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
915,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
916,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
917,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
918,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
919,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
920,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
921,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
922,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
923,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance.

I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
941,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
942,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
943,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
944,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
945,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
946,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
947,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
948,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
949,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
950,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
951,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
952,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
953,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
954,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
955,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
956,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
957,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
958,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
959,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
960,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait.

977,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
978,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
979,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
980,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
981,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
982,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
983,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
984,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
985,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
986,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
987,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
988,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
989,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
990,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
991,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
992,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
993,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
994,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
995,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."

They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1015,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1016,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1017,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1018,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1019,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1020,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1021,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1022,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1023,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1024,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1025,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1026,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1027,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1028,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1029,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1030,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1031,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1032,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1033,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1034,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant.

1053,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1054,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1055,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1056,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1057,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1058,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1059,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1060,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1061,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1062,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1063,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1064,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1065,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1066,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1067,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1068,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1069,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1070,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1071,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."

1088,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1089,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1090,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1091,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1092,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1093,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1094,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1095,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1096,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1097,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1098,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1099,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1100,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1101,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1102,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1103,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1104,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1105,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1106,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1107,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"

We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1128,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1129,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1130,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1131,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1132,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1133,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1134,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1135,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1136,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1137,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1138,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1139,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1140,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1141,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1142,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1143,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1144,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1145,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1146,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."

1164,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1165,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1166,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1167,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1168,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1169,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1170,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1171,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1172,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1173,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1174,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1175,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1176,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1177,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1178,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1179,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1180,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1181,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1182,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1183,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"

I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1201,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1202,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1203,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1204,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1205,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1206,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1207,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1208,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1209,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1210,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1211,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1212,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1213,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1214,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1215,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1216,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1217,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1218,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1219,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1220,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait.

1237,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1238,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1239,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1240,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1241,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1242,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1243,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1244,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1245,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1246,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1247,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1248,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1249,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1250,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1251,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1252,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1253,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1254,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1255,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."

Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1275,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1276,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1277,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1278,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1279,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1280,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1281,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1282,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1283,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1284,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1285,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1286,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1287,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1288,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1289,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1290,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1291,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1292,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1293,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1294,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door.

1312,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1313,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1314,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1315,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1316,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1317,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1318,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1319,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1320,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1321,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1322,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1323,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1324,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1325,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1326,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1327,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1328,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1329,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1330,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1331,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."

1348,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1349,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1350,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1351,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1352,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1353,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1354,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1355,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1356,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1357,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1358,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1359,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1360,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1361,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1362,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1363,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1364,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1365,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1366,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1367,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"

We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1388,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1389,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1390,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1391,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1392,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1393,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1394,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1395,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1396,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1397,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1398,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1399,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1400,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1401,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1402,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1403,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1404,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1405,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1406,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."

1424,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1425,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1426,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1427,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1428,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1429,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1430,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1431,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1432,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1433,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1434,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1435,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1436,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1437,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1438,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1439,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
1440,"There was a line outside the restaurant when we arrived and we were taken to our requested sushi bar seats after a 20-30 minute wait. The food and service were worth waiting for- fantastic throughout the meal. I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1441,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1442,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1443,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"

I dined with one other person, initially expecting to just have a light snack but ending up staying longer and ordering a bottle of sake then two other dishes.  If the server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout the meal, he didn't show it.  We sat in front of the grill and enjoyed watching the chef work while we talked, occasionally asking other patrons what they had ordered and taking mental notes for future visits (the gentleman next to us ordered spare ribs that slid right off the bone!).  What I liked about the food was that it was simple and beautifully presented- no crazy sauces, bells and whistles, smoke and mirrors, etc.- just good food laid out in a pleasing way that begged to be enjoyed: the miso soup was hot and yummy, the sashimi was wonderful, the cold soba noodles were as delicious as they were pretty.  Looking forward to my next meal here already!"
1461,"All 3 of my sushi rolls barely had fish in them. I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of fish per roll. There was so little fish and so much rice, I could mainly only taste rice; I couldn't even appreciate the fish taste. I've been excited for WEEKS to finally try Kirala. They always have a huge wait. I went later in the dinner rush 8pm and the wait was 20 minutes, very tolerable. Maybe the sushi dinner that includes a lot of nagiri is more worth the money. I highly recommend you don't order the sushi rolls."
1462,"I came back to this place after 16 years hiatus having moved to the east coast. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. We started the evening in the bar area. We were seated before our drinks were served. However, our drinks didn't arrive st our table until we were a quarter into our dinner. Whilst all the fish were of premium quality, the rice tasted as if it had been boiled in a pot and sitting since the night before. The service was definitely sporadic, frantic and unorganized. The east bay has a wealth of great Japanese restaurants so I don't k ow if I'll be back."
1463,"Questionable location in an area of south Berkeley that has mostly foreclosed properties, but worth the visit for the amazing Unagi and superb ambiance. I also recommend the skewers off the Robata menu. The chicken-stuffed mushrooms were amazing! My favorite was the baby squid, which only goes for ~$4. The chicken with wasabi and plum sauce is also delicious. Already mentioned above, but the unagi is a MUST. The rice was also very buttery, but not super soft-- a killer combination haha! Lastly, the match cheese cake looked great! I cut sugar out of my diet, so I didn't have any, but I think my friend thoroughly enjoyed it :PPrice is another topic. We spent about $67 on all mentioned above. Definitely one of the more pricey japanese restaurants I've been to, but I think it's worth the visit!"
1464,"We were a bit early for the weekday lunch service and a line has already formed.  Soon it opens, the place is almost packed with customers,  Another wait to be served.  I was hoping to sit at the counter for grilled items, unfortunately, I guess it's not in the lunch menu.  The menu was simple for lunch service.  The service was not as impressive as the food.  It was just a prolonged process to get a menu, order, and add additional items.  The ""kitchen"" lunch box was interesting, did not except everything in small proportion.  The meal comprised of a small bowl of simple udon and rice.  Soup base is clear,  Several tempura veggies and one piece of shrimp.  It was crispy but missing the dipping sauce.  The four slices of beef teriyaki was tender and  delightful.  We also ordered the Sushi delight, that was a winner, but still a small portion for its price.  Fish was exquisitely fresh and roll was yummy. Need to come back for dinner service and for their grilled items."
1465,"Got here at 6:15pm on a Saturday and we had to put our name on a list. Just for the two of us the estimated wait was 45 mins, but we sat down in 30! There's a small waiting area in the back to stay warm or have a drink. Their food was amazing! I got to say it's one of the best quality I've had. You really don't need to use soy sauce on the fish, the fish itself flavorful enough. This place deserves a 4.5 star, only reason why it's not 5 is because it was really hard to get a waiter's attention and we went for a really long time without water :("
1466,"Parking: lots of metered parking and close to the BART station.I had the ginger beef and fried mix tempera with the soba salad. I didn't get to try the sushi but I just thought the food was just okay and comparable to any other place. I didn't find anything special. We got there 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a line formed outside already, so if you want to come here for dinner, either go early to get a seat or else you'd have to wait a bit, there were loads of people waiting for a table but the good thing is, they had a bar where you can just order drinks while you wait."
1467,"Let me start by saying that I had a really great dining experience here!I came in with pretty high expectations for the following reasons: 1) a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated was outside the door, kind of intimidating2) a sticker from a bunch of reviews/recommenders plastered on their front door3) I heard mixed comments about this place--good and bad--so I wanted to see for myself!We came without making reservations, but despite the line, the attendant let us write our name and table preference (bar or table--and I put either bar or table, whichever is faster). We were told that the wait time was about 30 minutes (on a Friday night), but we really only waited ~20 minutes.What I highly recommend:- while waiting to be seated, chill at the bar and get yourself and a friend some sake (or wine or cocktail).- It's best to come in knowing your preference. For example, do you like your sake fruity or dry? Only you can know your preference, and the bartender can only sample so much given the volume of customers.- I had the ""Izumi Judan,"" which is bone dry, really crisp, and well balanced. I don't like the fruity stuff, so knowing what I don't like helped the bartender gauge what I probably would like.- Although the bartender was too busy, and for that reason, the customer service from him was not very pleasant, I don't blame him for it. It can get really overwhelming behind the bar so our interaction was sort of rushed.After about 20 minutes of good talk and martini-like sake shots, we were invited to the sushi bar where we got to watch the pros cheerfully work together. It was very charming to watch them do their work; they make it look too natural and easy! The chefs kept us entertained as we shared stories about our common hobby of fishing across the bay! In terms of food, I highly recommend:- (please get & try) the grilled chicken stuffed mushroom!- grilled chicken teriyaki- tuna nigiriTheir fish selections are really fresh, most especially the tuna, which was reminiscent of precious jade. I mean, the tuna was deep red, moist, almost translucent, and shiny, so you know it's truly fresh. On top of it, it tasted delicious! I know a food is really gratifying if it makes me do my happy dance--and that's just what I did, I danced mellowly, shimmying my shoulders from side to side as the tuna kind of melts and play with my taste buds. We also got the:- spicy crab roll with asparagus tempura, and- spicy tuna rollboth of which were good too! The sushi rolls come in smaller portions than other restaurants, but it's the kind of portion that I can actually fit in my mouth perfectly without stretching my entire mouth too much! Lol.The entire experience consisting of delicious food, drink, service, casual ambience, and everything else, turned out to be a great dining experience. Very friendly servers, funny and entertaining chefs, and down to earth stranger-customers. I enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate about coming back!"
1468,"Whenever I walked by Kirala, I was always amazed by the lines of people waiting outside the door.  Thinking that this must be an excellent Japanese restaurant, I decided to try one night, and luckily, there was not too long of a wait.  However, while I was waiting to be impressed, my dinner was more on the average side of things.The things I liked: I though the sushi was pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tempura and salmon skin rolls, and they were generally well constructed and flavorful.  There was a dried spice on the salmon skin roll that gave it a complexity that was surprising but tasty.  I also decided to try some of the grilled items, and this is where my meal becomes disappointing.  The shishito peppers had a nice char to them, but the peppers' skins had a tough texture that made them less appealing as I ate them.  I tend to enjoy mackerel, but the grilled saba was bland and forgettable.  Despite the busy evening, I thought the service was attentive and prompt.  Overall, it was an average dinner experience, but I would not be against trying Kirala again."
1469,"Third time and still loving it!Spicy tuna roll - Not spicy, with a kick, fresh, soft, and cold.Hamachi Teriyaki - Thick slice of savory, overly glazed fish that felt a tiny bit overcooked.Shitake mushroom robata - Bursting with so much mushroom flavor, we had to order this twice.Stuffed peppers robata - Average, spicy. Eggplant robata - Small slices that complimented the shredding topping rather than the topping complimenting the eggplant."
1470,The place was crowded. Food was super expensive. I personally have tried a lot of Japanese restaurant bit this one did not meet my expectation.Ordered $17  and received 4 big pieces. Did not taste very good.
1471,"I got take-out from here at lunch. It was pretty busy, but I was impressed at how quickly they got my order together.Food: I got edamame, avocado rolls, and the matcha green tea cheesecake. The green tea cheesecake was delicious, and worth it (even if it was a bit pricey). The edamame and avocado roll were average. Service: Really friendly staff, and very helpful and accommodating. It's clear that they are especially nice to regulars.Overall, I'd probably check this place out again, and maybe try the noodle dishes. That seemed to be the more popular choice when I was there."
1472,"People really rave about this place. Maybe I am spoiled by sushi in LA. It's good, it's a nice place, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Solid 3 stars."
1473,"Whenever I passed this place I always wondered if it was worth the wait. Decided to test my luck on a rainy afternoon to see if that would beat the crowd and it did to an extent. I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 6:30. No line out the door but it still took about 30 mins to be seated for just 2 people. I give the food 5/5 stars. We ended up getting the rock n roll, rainbow roll, seafood stir fry noodles, and a spider roll. All rolls were delicious and tasted fresh. You can definitely taste he quality of what they serve you here. I thought I would need to order more rolls since I was in a sushi mood but what we got was enough to share. The rainbow roll was definitely my favorite since it had a great mix of different fishes. The spider roll was a close second for being spicy enough but not overwhelming. It tasted great with the ginger. The noodles were also tasty and they give you A TON (a 2 meal kind of thing). The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter only filled my water once the entire time we were there and it was difficult to get their attention especially when it started to get even more packed around 7-7:30ish. They do get the food out to you quite quickly but in terms of getting your check it does take a while. Would come again to try their other dishes and dessert since they smelled delicious."
1474,"Kirala is a wonderful Japanese restaurant for a casual lunch or a fun night with friends located in a quieter area of Berkeley near the popular Berkeley Bowl supermarket.I've been here on three different occasions, twice for dinner and once for lunch. I came here for a birthday lunch celebration and found that it wasn't very busy at lunchtime. However, for my dinner visits, there was always a line going out the door. My first visit on a Sunday evening, I arrived 15 minutes before opening hours and there was already a line that wrapped around the street corner. Come early or expect a waiting line for dinner!I've tried some of their grilled items during dinner including their lamb chop, corn, and eggplant. They all had that nice grill and char flavor that one dreams about when doing a barbecue though I found the prices to be a bit steep for what they were. The lamb chop was especially good though with all its succulent juices oozing out as it is being cut. I've tried their sushi combo and their chirashi and I've got to say that they're both amazing. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is done just right, and the presentation is vibrant and colorful. You can't go wrong with either of those two choices.Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu and consists of reasonably priced delicious choices. I ordered their seafood udon which was everything I could've wished for in a seafood udon. There was a great chewy texture in the noodles bathed in a wonderful hot broth with a wide variety of seafood and vegetables throughout which made for a dish that really warms you up and makes you feel comfortable."
1475,"Been coming here for over 16 years. Usually when I'm in the area shopping at Berkeley Bowl. Had a bit of love and hate relationship as the food quality has been kind of coming and going. And like the U.S. economy it's on the up cycle right now. Better than 2 years ago and way better than 12 years ago.Wednesday at 7 pm can be good as no wait. If you know about Japanese Kaiseki style cuisine,  aka imperial court haute cuisine served in Japan, I think you can organize your meal in that fashion with what they have to offer. Sushi is very fresh. grilled varies veggies and meat are fresh. For the non initiated, teriyaki is good here. For those who are into the robata, this maybe one of the few ones that offer authentic ones in the bay area. Having had a good experience after a number of years of trial and error at this place, my faith is renewed."
1476,"I echo some earlier reviewers who don't get why this place is so popular.  No reservations, but we tried to beat the rush by getting there just after 6pm on a Friday.  Yikes.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated.  Place was packed, bar was overflowing, had to semi-yell across the table to be heard.  I was starving, and decided to forego sushi in favor of something more filling.  Waitress was curt.  Ohitashi (cold spinach) was pretty good; nice, smokey bonito flakes on top.  I was excited to see seafood gyoza (our usual japanese place only has pork), but the filling was disappointing; flavorless, and the dipping sauce didn't add much.  I was tempted by the almond-crusted shrimp tempura, but at over $10 for two shrimp, I decided to go with the regular tempura, which was the same price, still just two shrimp, but vegetables as well.  This was the best thing I ate there.  Dipping sauce had grated ginger in it; nice touch.  Grilled shiitake was pretty good.Steamed rice managed to be both mushy AND crunchy.  Not good.  I did appreciate that they offer several cold sakes in small carafes.  The one I ordered was described as having a green apple flavor, which it did.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but nice.  Both the glass carafe and tiny glass sake glass were lovely.  My husband is low-carbing it, so he ordered five robata items, but  he wasn't over the moon about any of them.  The bill, including one small sake and excluding tip, was $75.  Not really worth it. Next time we're in the area, we'll look elsewhere."
1477,"This place is GREAT.  It definitely lives up to the hype.  There's always a long line, so make sure you have time to put your name in and wait outside for your table.  Everything I tried was very good.  I'm trusting that this spot won't be affected by Honda moving into the old Any Mountain space next store.  It would be an absolute TRAGEDY if the restaurant were moved!!!"
1478,"Let me preface by saying that although I haven't been here in 2017 yet, this has been my family's go-to Japanese restaurant since before Yelp existed, as such I'm probably biased as well as selectively a bit extra critical. My tempura appetizer was crispy to perfection (as usual) and the fish on my Sushi Dinner was so fresh I could see my reflection in it. Only critique today was that the seaweed salad appetizer could have been drained a bit more --but that's just splitting hairs. Final verdict: Still best Japanese spot in the Bay Area IMO. Btw be sure to get here 15-20 minutes early as there is usually a long line outside."
1479,"Some great toro to be enjoyed.  The rest was average.  Had all nigiri, as none of it was standout enough to inspire the order of a roll.  Ahi of the night was bigeye tuna, great on texture and color, but the flavor was not memorable.  Uni was nice as was the white king salmon, could have went without both though.  Red Crab was a waste of time.  Most of the patrons were getting cooked orders, so i guess sushi isn't the greatest here.  I tried the lamb off the robato grill, found it overcooked and not awesome on flavor, heard the gindara (black cod) was the best there.Stick with the toro, it's certifiable.. but the price was $$$$ for that item.  The sushi chefs cut with precision, not big portions, but not terrible."
