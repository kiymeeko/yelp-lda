0,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
1,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
2,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
3,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
4,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
5,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
6,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
7,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
8,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
9,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
10,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
11,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
12,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
13,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
14,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
15,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
16,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
17,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
18,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
19,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.

21,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.

They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
23,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place.

That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
38,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
39,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
40,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
41,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
42,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
43,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
44,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
45,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
46,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
47,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
48,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
49,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
50,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
51,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
52,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
53,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
54,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
55,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
56,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
57,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
58,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."

And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
73,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
74,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
75,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
76,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
77,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
78,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
79,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
80,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
81,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
82,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
83,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
84,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
85,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
86,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
87,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
88,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
89,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
90,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
91,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
92,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
93,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
94,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."

Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
109,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
110,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
111,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
112,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
113,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
114,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
115,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
116,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
117,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
118,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
119,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
120,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
121,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
122,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
123,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
124,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
125,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
126,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
127,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
128,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."

He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
147,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
148,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
149,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
150,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
151,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
152,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
153,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
154,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
155,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
156,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
157,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
158,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
159,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
160,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
161,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
162,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
163,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
164,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
165,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
166,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food.

Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
186,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
187,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
188,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
189,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
190,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
191,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
192,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
193,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
194,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
195,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
196,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
197,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
198,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
199,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
200,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
201,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
202,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
203,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
204,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
205,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."

Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
221,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
222,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
223,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
224,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
225,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
226,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
227,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
228,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
229,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
230,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
231,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
232,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
233,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
234,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
235,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
236,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
237,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
238,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
239,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
240,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
241,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.

The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
243,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place.

It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
258,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
259,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
260,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
261,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
262,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
263,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
264,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
265,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
266,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
267,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
268,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
269,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
270,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
271,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
272,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
273,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
274,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
275,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
276,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
277,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
278,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."

And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
293,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
294,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
295,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
296,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
297,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
298,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
299,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
300,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
301,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
302,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
303,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
304,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
305,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
306,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
307,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
308,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
309,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
310,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
311,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
312,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
313,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
314,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
315,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost.

Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
329,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
330,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
331,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
332,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
333,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
334,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
335,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
336,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
337,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
338,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
339,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
340,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
341,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
342,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
343,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
344,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
345,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
346,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
347,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
348,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service.

The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
367,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
368,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
369,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
370,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
371,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
372,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
373,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
374,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
375,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
376,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
377,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
378,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
379,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
380,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
381,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
382,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
383,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
384,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
385,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
386,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky?

The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good?

I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
406,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
407,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
408,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
409,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
410,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
411,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
412,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
413,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
414,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
415,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
416,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
417,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
418,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
419,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
420,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
421,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
422,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
423,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
424,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
425,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible.

The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
441,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
442,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
443,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
444,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
445,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
446,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
447,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
448,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
449,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
450,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
451,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
452,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
453,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
454,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
455,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
456,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
457,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
458,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
459,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
460,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
461,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.

The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."

It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
478,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
479,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
480,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
481,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
482,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
483,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
484,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
485,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
486,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
487,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
488,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
489,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
490,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
491,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
492,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
493,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
494,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
495,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
496,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
497,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
498,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly.

And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
513,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
514,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
515,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
516,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
517,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
518,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
519,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
520,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
521,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
522,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
523,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
524,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
525,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
526,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
527,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
528,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
529,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
530,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
531,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
532,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
533,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
534,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
535,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost.

Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
549,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
550,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
551,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
552,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
553,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
554,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
555,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
556,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
557,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
558,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
559,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
560,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
561,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
562,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
563,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
564,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
565,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
566,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
567,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
568,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service.

The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
587,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
588,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
589,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
590,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
591,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
592,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
593,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
594,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
595,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
596,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
597,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
598,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
599,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
600,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
601,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
602,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
603,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
604,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
605,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
606,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent.

The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food.

I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
626,"Customer service can make or break a meal, and how I ultimately may feel about the overall experience. I have been to Barney's several times, and found myself back there during a recent vacation. My previous meals were okay-ish, but enough for me to want to go back and try it again. First off, dont expect a lot of service. Barney's would be better off allowing customers to order in line, and go from there. Thats about the same service that you'll receive at the table. We were given our choice of two tables. Both incredibly tight seating, as in trying to squeeze between a rock and a hard place to get into the seat, with the thought from all of us, how are we getting out?! The table hadn't been wiped down, nor the seats. There wasn't an attempt to fix it either. Thankfully they keep cutlery and napkins at the table, so we cleaned it ourselves. #notmyresponsibility When the waiter came over, he was distracted by something, so when we asked a few questions, we were told that he would come back when we were ready. Um, we cant get ready, be ready, or are ready, unless we have our questions answered. Just a thought. We ordered curly fries, steak fries, a shake that we asked for two of us to share, a salad, and two cheesy burgers with grilled mushrooms. Im not sure what the rave is about the curly fries. They were hard, and frankly tasted like fast food. I was all into wanting the steak fries, and chalked my dislike of the curly fries, to my wanting them instead. Nope. Barely warm, super hard, and tasteless.  I used the ranch dressing to dip away the lack of fry taste. Lets just say, they have great ranch dressing. Its not the typical ranch, it has more of a dill like flavor. Super good! The salad isn't worth writing about. Basic, lack of difference, and overpriced. Two of us ordered the cheesy burgers. The menu promised several different types of cheeses melted all over a burger prepared my way. Great! We wanted sauteed mushrooms, and since the up charge was $1.75 we asked that the order be spilt between the two burgers. That shouldn't be complicated, right?! The fries arrived well ahead of the burgers. Maybe this is hush food? The shake quickly followed. In a single glass, with the extra on the side. Great. One straw, two people. No dice. We were really clear with the waiter who couldnt be bothered with service, that we wanted to split the shake. Fine, We shared the straw. Maybe there is a straw shortage? Or is it like the plastic bag charge of .10 cents, and they could have charged for the extra glass and straw that we were expecting. Here's where things get tricky. The burgers arrived, as did a plate of sauteed mushrooms. We stopped the guy delivering our food, and asked about the mushrooms. He wasn't our waiter, but maybe more like a deer in the headlights. He didnt know what todo, but was kind enough to ask if we wanted the kitchen to fix it. Um, no... service had been slow, and while we had filled up on dry fries, we still wanted our food.   The buns while they were sesame (my personal fav) looked and tasted like they had been microwaved. Hard, flavorless, and my only hope was that the burgers juice would soften the buns. They added a thimble size portion of thousand island to the plate. My impression is that they want the customer to pay for items that traditionally come with a burger in most places. Like fries. Add them to your cost, so that I am not having to order a la carte.The prices are already high, so you pretty much know that you're in for over $20.00 a person for a burger and fries. Remember i said this is where things get tricky? So my cheese wasn't anything special, the mushrooms werent seasoned, and as i added the juicy mess to my burger, i anxiously was hoping for the Mmm Mmm Mmm moment. The burger overall was decent. Im not kidding. This wasn't hunger talking either. The cheese wasn't melted on my burger, and frankly had the waiter come over even once, we would have potentially left with a better feeling about the experience. Why three stars you ask? Because the burger was prepared the way I ordered it, in terms of doneness etc. Put the mess together, and it wasn't that bad. Crazy, i know. Did I mention that the shake was really good? Chocolate oreo. The amount was perfect for two people, and would have been better if i had my own glass, so that I didnt feel like someones kid, having to share my parents food. Parking is impossible, and I noticed many people parking across the street at the local market, and sneaking into the restaurant. Im not advocating that (there are warning signs) but its dicey trying to park almost anywhere in and around the area."
627,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
628,"So the important things to know about Barney's: they have great curly fries and they have awesome milkshakes. Definitely two things I would highly recommend to anyone who is going there. Now as a vegetarian, Barney's does have a wide variety of options. However, over the years, I have seen a few of the options disappear off of the menu. You can order most or all of the specialty burgers with a garden burger patty so woohoo! Definite props for that. All the burgers are just so-so for me in terms of taste. The 2 vegetarian sandwiches, the veggie club and the barney's portobello mushroom, are both good, but somewhat uninteresting in my opinion. I haven't had the falafel pita in the past so I really can't say whether that option is good or bad. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 for food (those amazing curly fries and milkshakes), location, and service. Not a bad option if you're in the area, but not the first time I would go to for a burger and fries."
629,"Came here by myself waiting to go somewhere, had time to spare so I thought I would check it out.  I have been to the one in Albany, which I thought was good, and keeping up with that same atmosphere, this was just as good.  The time I went wasn't too crowded which I liked, and the waiters kept checking which also made it seem like they care about our experience which they do.  They made my burger to order which is good plus the spicy curly fries was not too spicy which is another plus for me.  Even their bathroom had cool posters of their Other Barney's location which I posted too"
630,"Loved it!! They have gluten free buns and it made me so happy I could eat a real burger. I got the ""gastropub burger"" and it was as delicious as you'd think!  It had so much bacon on it, cheese, potatoes, and my favorite an egg."
631,"Although Barney's is somewhat overpriced in a sense, their burger is pretty good -a nicely cooked patty with your choice of sauce. My favorite burger is Big Barneys Burger, a one-pounder, with blue cheese and bacon. I also like their fries - the ones that I usually get are Spicy Curly Fries and the Skinny fries. The fries are pretty big even if you order small. If I order the one-pound burger, the fries and a drink, it would cost just above $20. It is pretty expensive from my perspective when you can get the four by four burger, animal fries and coke for just under $15 from In-N-Out.Update: I went to this restaurant again on April 30, 2017, and ordered the Western Burger, which has bacon, onion, and BBQ sauce inside. It was much better than the Big Barneys. The combination of onion and BBQ sauce never disappoints you. Hence, I changed my mind and give this place 4 stars. In addition, I apologize for the typos that I made in the original review."
632,"The burgers at Barney's have sort of a backyard barbecue quality to them. So depending on how good you are with a grill, that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. For me, it was kind of a bad thing. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. I mean, it does say ""gourmet hamburgers"" out front, does it not? But these are not gourmet by any means -- home-style yes, gourmet no. In other words, these are your father's hamburgers.I had the Baja Burger ($11.50) and, to be honest, it was kind of disappointing. The meat was cooked to medium, not medium rare as I had requested, and it was woefully underseasoned. The buns also reminded me of Five Guys, which I am not a fan of. However, the bacon was crisp and the avocado was cool and creamy. The side of Spicy Curly Fries ($3.95) could have been hotter (both in temperature and spice) but they were still pretty addictive. And the Oreo Shake ($5.95) was, as expected, absolutely terrific; pretty hard to screw that up though.So if you're looking for a good old-fashioned diners-drive-ins-and-dives burger, then Barney's is your place. Just ignore the signage, and you should be fine.2 1/2 stars"
633,Moderately good burger but my mouth would be happier at In N Out Burger.Atmosphere excellent. Outside deck is great for ambience and drinking a beer. Fries are good too but the burger can be better.
634,"Been here a few times and the food is always consistent. I've had their western burger, hummus plate and recently the BBQ chicken salad. All are good and delicious. The sweet potato fries are legit and the service here is always good. Nice offer coloring books and crayons for the kiddies. Also great natural lighting to take photos of your food."
635,"This place is called Barney's gourmet HAMBURGERS which implies meat...I understand people re vegetarian and they definitely offer some options but this place is a hamburger place first and foremost. If you are a fellow carnivorous friend and love burgers, Barney's is awesome. Their fries, shakes, sodas, beers and draft kombucha are great accompaniments. You can get a variety of burgers here and bread choices. The burgers are huge compared to other places in Berkeley that charge the same price. If you are really hungry, you can even get a one pounder! They also offer chicken breast, veggie patties and salmon burgers as a choice if you so desire. On top of being a great burger joint, they do give you huge salads. Their salads with meat on them do tend to be better. However, if you are a vegetarian, skip the salads and go for their middle eastern plate. That thing is huge and satisfying.  I also bloat up like a baloon when I eat gluten, so they have gluten free buns. If you don't want to or can't eat white potatoes, there are sweet potato fries. They even have hot dog plates that come with fries for under $8. This is also a great place to chill and watch a game. I went there so many times during the Cubs quest towards the world series. I've had gatherings here with friends. I've also eaten outside a great deal. Every time I've been here, it's been great. Sometimes they get really busy between dine-in and take-out orders. Really though, the service has always been great. It's just a nice place to grab a burger, a drink and hang out."
636,"A delightful, quaint, and flavorful burger joint that will thoroughly satisfy your burger cravings. The Sweet Potato Fries were great; I really loved the chipotle aioli. The star of the show - the Alpine burger - was also on point. I love burgers with sautéed onions and mushrooms and this burger definitely hit the stop. Bonus points for actually cooking my burger medium!"
637,"You ever have a burger that has juice dripping down your wrists? That's Barney's in a nutshell.Omfgggg these burgers are good.They have a list of specialty burgers, but you can still customize them how you like. I got the Chipotle burger with a turkey patty, switch out the Jack cheese for provolone, and minus the red onion. It was a little complicated but they didn't charge extra for my order, and the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all, which was great!We also shared the spicy curly fries, which actually weren't spicy at all. They were, however, super crispy and fresh, and tasted great with the peppery ranch sauce! I ordered the small but our server accidentally took it down as the large, which was fine because my bf and I devoured the whole thing anyway.It's a little pricy but totally worth it, because the taste and quality is great!"
638,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
639,One of my go to burger joints. I've been to both the college and shattuck locations and both are really nice. Ambiance: They have indoor/outdoor seating at both locations so it's really nice to be able to do either. Nice open and clean spaces for both.Service: Servers were really friendly at both and were attentive to our groups even though we were 10+ both times i've been. Food: I come here for their bacon burgers and sweet potato/curly fries (both are SO GOOD). I liked that my bacon burger had legit/thick pieces of bacon. I got my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The burgers here are huge and with an order of fries you'll definitely leave stuffed.
640,"This is the place to go in Berkeley if you want a burger that's a bit more sophisticated than your regular burger joint. The location is good, the staff is a hit or miss, but the food quality is always consistently good. I've visited this restaurants numerous times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. They know how to make a medium rare burger! Obviously this is a bit more pricy than let's say Bongo Burgers, but then you are paying for the quality and options. Both have their merits and I don't particularly think it's a good comparison other than on price - pay more to get more/better. Their fries are also pretty decent and I always opt out for garlic and truffle. The location is lovely (albeit far from south side where most students reside which could be a plus or a minus in your eyes) but the staff is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are great and others... well, you know. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area who is in the mood for a burger but wants something a bit more special."
641,I had the Baja Burger... and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.Boom. Review: over.
642,"Menu: I got the gastropub burger (medium-well (lol) with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a pretzel bun). The patty was rather bland, pretzel bun tasted exactly like a regular bun, but at least the bacon was delicious. I also got the Amber Ale which was really nice and a glass of Merlot. They filled the Merlot glass like it was a goblet... ;) Score! Ambiance: This has the same feel as Crepevine (which is interesting given they're right next to one another). The inside would have been cute 5-10 years ago, but now feels a bit outdated. The tables are functional and decorations a bit chaotic (one of their window displays is just rows and rows of unopened Hellmann's mayonnaise and Heinz ketchup bottles.) I'll be happy to come back to Barney's but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that they upgrade their interior."
643,"Omg omg omgThis is my anytime go to place. Love their hot burgers and milkshakes... vanilla, Hershey's and coffee ones are the best They don't have good selection of cold sandwiches, which they should at least for vegetarians. Tipped off the one star only for this. And yes, come prepared for no available parking or rather reach in advance."
644,Good selection of beers on tap. Huge selection of burgers to choose from. My friend really enjoy her cheeseburger. I made the mistake of ordering the falafel pita. The pita and falafel were both dry. I definitely should have ordered a vegetarian burger. Even the small orders of fries are huge. Get one to split.
645,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible.
