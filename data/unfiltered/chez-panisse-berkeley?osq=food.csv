0,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
2,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
3,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
4,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
5,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
6,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
7,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
8,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
9,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
10,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
11,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
12,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
13,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
14,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
15,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
16,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
17,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
18,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
19,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
20,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
21,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
22,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
23,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
24,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
25,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
26,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
27,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
28,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
29,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
30,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
31,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
32,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
33,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
34,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
35,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
36,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
37,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
38,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
39,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
40,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
41,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
42,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
43,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
44,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
45,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
46,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
47,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
48,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
49,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
50,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
51,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
52,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
53,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
54,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
55,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
56,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
57,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
58,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
59,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
60,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
61,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
62,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
63,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
64,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
65,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
66,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
67,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
68,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
69,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
70,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
71,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
72,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
73,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
74,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
75,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
76,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
77,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
78,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
79,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
80,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
81,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
82,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
83,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
84,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
85,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
86,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
87,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
88,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
89,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
90,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
91,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
92,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
93,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
94,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
95,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
96,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
97,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
98,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
99,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
100,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
101,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
102,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
103,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
104,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
105,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
106,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
107,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
108,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
109,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
110,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
111,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
112,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
113,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
114,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
115,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
116,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
117,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
118,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
119,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
120,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
121,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
122,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
123,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
124,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
125,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
126,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
127,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
128,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
129,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
130,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
131,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
132,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
133,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
134,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
135,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
136,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
137,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
138,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
139,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
140,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
141,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
142,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
143,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
144,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
145,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
146,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
147,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
148,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
149,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
150,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
151,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
152,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
153,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
154,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
155,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
156,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
157,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
158,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
159,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
160,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
161,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
162,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
163,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
164,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
165,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
166,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
167,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
168,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
169,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
170,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
171,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
172,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
173,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
174,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
175,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
176,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
177,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
178,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
179,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
180,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
181,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
182,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
183,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
184,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
185,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
186,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
187,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
188,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
189,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
190,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
191,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
192,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
193,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
194,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
195,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
196,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
197,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
198,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
199,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
200,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
201,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
202,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
203,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
204,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
205,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
206,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
207,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
208,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
209,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
210,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
211,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
212,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
213,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
214,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
215,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
216,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
217,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
218,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
219,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
220,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
221,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
222,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
223,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
224,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
225,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
226,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
227,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
228,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
229,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
230,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
231,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
232,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
233,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
234,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
235,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
236,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
237,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
238,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
239,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
240,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
241,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
242,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
243,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
244,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
245,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
246,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
247,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
248,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
249,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
250,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
251,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
252,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
253,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
254,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
255,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
256,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
257,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
258,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
259,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
260,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
261,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
262,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
263,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
264,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
265,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
266,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
267,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
268,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
269,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
270,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
271,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
272,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
273,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
274,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
275,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
276,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
277,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
278,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
279,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
280,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
281,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
282,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
283,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
284,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
285,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
286,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
287,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
288,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
289,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
290,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
291,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
292,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
293,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
294,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
295,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
296,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
297,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
298,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
299,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
300,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
301,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
302,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
303,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
304,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
305,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
306,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
307,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
308,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
309,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
310,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
311,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
312,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
313,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
314,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
315,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
316,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
317,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
318,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
319,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
320,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
321,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
322,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
323,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
324,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
325,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
326,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
327,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
328,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
329,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
330,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
331,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
332,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
333,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
334,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
335,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
336,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
337,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
338,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
339,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
340,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
341,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
342,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
343,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
344,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
345,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
346,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
347,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
348,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
349,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
350,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
351,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
352,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
353,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
354,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
355,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
356,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
357,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
358,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
359,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
360,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
361,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
362,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
363,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
364,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
365,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
366,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
367,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
368,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
369,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
370,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
371,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
372,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
373,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
374,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
375,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
376,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
377,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
378,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
379,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
380,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
381,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
382,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
383,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
384,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
385,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
386,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
387,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
388,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
389,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
390,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
391,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
392,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
393,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
394,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
395,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
396,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
397,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
398,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
399,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
400,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
401,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
402,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
403,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
404,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
405,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
406,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
407,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
408,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
409,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
410,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
411,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
412,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
413,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
414,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
415,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
416,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
417,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
418,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
419,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
420,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
421,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
422,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
423,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
424,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
425,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
426,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
427,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
428,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
429,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
430,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
431,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
432,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
433,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
434,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
435,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
436,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
437,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
438,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
439,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
440,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
441,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
442,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
443,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
444,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
445,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
446,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
447,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
448,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
449,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
450,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
451,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
452,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
453,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
454,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
455,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
456,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
457,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
458,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
459,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
460,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
461,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
462,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
463,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
464,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
465,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
466,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
467,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
468,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
469,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
470,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
471,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
472,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
473,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
474,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
475,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
476,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
477,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
478,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
479,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
480,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
481,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
482,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
483,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
484,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
485,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
486,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
487,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
488,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
489,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
490,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
491,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
492,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
493,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
494,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
495,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
496,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
497,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
498,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
499,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
500,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
501,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
502,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
503,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
504,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
505,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
506,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
507,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
508,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
509,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
510,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
511,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
512,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
513,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
514,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
515,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
516,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
517,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
518,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
519,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
520,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
521,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
522,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
523,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
524,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
525,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
526,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
527,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
528,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
529,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
530,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
531,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
532,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
533,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
534,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
535,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
536,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
537,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
538,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
539,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
540,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
541,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
542,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
543,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
544,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
545,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
546,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
547,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
548,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
549,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
550,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
551,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
552,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
553,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
554,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
555,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
556,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
557,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
558,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
559,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
560,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
561,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
562,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
563,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
564,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
565,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
566,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
567,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
568,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
569,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
570,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
571,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
572,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
573,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
574,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
575,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
576,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
577,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
578,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
579,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
580,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
581,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
582,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
583,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
584,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
585,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
586,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
587,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
588,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
589,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
590,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
591,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
592,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
593,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
594,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
595,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
596,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
597,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
598,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
599,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
600,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
601,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
602,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
603,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
604,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
605,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
606,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
607,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
608,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
609,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
610,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
611,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
612,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
613,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
614,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
615,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
616,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
617,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
618,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
619,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
620,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
621,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
622,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
623,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
624,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
625,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
626,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
627,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
628,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
629,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
630,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
631,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
632,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
633,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
634,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
635,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
636,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
637,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
638,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
639,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
640,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
641,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
642,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
643,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
644,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
645,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
646,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
647,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
648,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
649,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
650,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
651,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
652,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
653,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
654,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
655,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
656,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
657,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
658,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
659,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
660,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
661,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
662,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
663,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
664,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
665,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
666,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
667,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
668,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
669,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
670,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
671,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
672,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
673,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
674,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
675,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
676,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
677,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
678,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
679,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
680,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
681,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
682,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
683,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
684,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
685,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
686,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
687,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
688,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
689,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
690,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
691,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
692,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
693,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
694,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
695,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
696,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
697,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
698,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
699,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
700,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
701,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
702,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
703,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
704,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
705,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
706,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
707,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
708,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
709,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
710,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
711,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
712,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
713,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
714,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
715,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
716,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
717,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
718,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
719,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
720,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
721,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
722,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
723,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
724,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
725,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
726,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
727,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
728,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
729,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
730,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
731,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
732,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
733,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
734,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
735,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
736,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
737,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
738,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
739,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
740,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
741,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
742,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
743,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
744,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
745,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
746,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
747,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
748,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
749,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
750,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
751,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
752,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
753,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
754,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
755,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
756,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
757,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
758,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
759,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
760,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
761,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
762,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
763,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
764,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
765,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
766,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
767,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
768,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
769,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
770,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
771,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
772,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
773,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
774,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
775,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
776,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
777,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
778,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
779,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
780,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
781,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
782,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
783,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
784,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
785,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
786,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
787,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
788,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
789,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
790,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
791,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
792,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
793,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
794,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
795,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
796,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
797,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
798,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
799,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
800,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
801,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
802,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
803,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
804,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
805,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
806,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
807,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
808,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
809,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
810,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
811,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
812,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
813,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
814,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
815,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
816,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
817,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
818,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
819,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
820,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
821,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
822,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
823,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
824,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
825,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
826,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
827,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
828,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
829,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
830,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
831,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
832,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
833,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
834,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
835,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
836,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
837,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
838,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
839,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
840,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
841,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
842,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
843,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
844,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
845,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
846,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
847,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
848,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
849,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
850,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
851,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
852,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
853,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
854,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
855,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
856,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
857,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
858,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
859,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
860,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
861,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
862,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
863,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
864,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
865,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
866,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
867,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
868,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
869,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
870,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
871,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
872,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
873,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
874,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
875,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
876,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
877,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
878,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
879,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
880,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
881,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
882,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
883,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
884,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
885,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
886,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
887,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
888,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
889,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
890,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
891,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
892,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
893,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
894,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
895,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
896,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
897,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
898,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
899,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
900,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
901,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
902,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
903,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
904,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
905,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
906,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
907,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
908,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
909,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
910,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
911,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
912,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
913,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
914,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
915,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
916,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
917,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
918,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
919,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
920,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
921,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
922,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
923,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
924,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
925,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
926,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
927,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
928,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
929,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
930,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
931,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
932,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
933,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
934,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
935,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
936,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
937,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
938,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
939,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
940,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
941,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
942,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
943,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
944,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
945,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
946,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
947,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
948,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
949,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
950,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
951,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
952,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
953,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
954,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
955,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
956,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
957,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
958,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
959,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
960,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
961,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
962,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
963,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
964,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
965,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
966,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
967,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
968,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
969,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
970,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
971,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
972,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
973,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
974,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
975,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
976,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
977,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
978,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
979,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
980,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
981,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
982,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
983,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
984,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
985,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
986,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
987,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
988,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
989,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
990,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
991,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
992,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
993,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
994,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
995,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
996,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
997,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
998,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
999,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1000,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1001,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1002,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1003,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1004,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1005,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1006,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1007,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1008,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1009,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1010,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1011,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1012,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1013,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1014,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1015,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1016,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1017,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1018,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1019,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1020,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1021,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1022,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1023,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1024,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1025,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1026,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1027,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1028,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1029,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1030,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1031,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1032,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1033,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1034,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1035,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1036,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1037,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1038,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1039,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1040,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1041,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1042,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1043,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1044,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1045,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1046,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1047,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1048,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1049,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1050,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1051,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1052,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1053,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1054,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1055,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1056,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1057,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1058,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1059,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1060,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1061,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1062,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1063,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1064,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1065,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1066,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1067,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1068,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1069,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1070,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1071,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1072,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1073,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1074,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1075,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1076,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1077,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1078,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1079,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1080,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1081,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1082,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1083,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1084,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1085,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1086,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1087,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1088,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1089,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1090,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1091,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1092,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1093,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1094,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1095,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1096,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1097,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1098,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1099,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1100,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1101,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1102,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1103,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1104,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1105,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1106,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1107,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1108,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1109,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1110,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1111,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1112,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1113,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1114,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1115,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1116,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1117,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1118,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1119,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1120,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1121,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1122,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1123,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1124,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1125,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1126,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1127,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1128,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1129,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1130,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1131,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1132,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1133,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1134,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1135,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1136,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1137,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1138,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1139,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1140,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1141,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1142,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1143,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1144,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1145,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1146,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1147,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1148,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1149,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1150,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1151,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1152,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1153,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1154,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1155,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1156,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1157,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1158,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1159,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1160,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1161,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1162,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1163,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1164,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1165,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1166,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1167,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1168,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1169,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1170,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1171,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1172,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1173,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1174,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1175,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1176,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1177,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1178,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1179,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1180,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1181,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1182,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1183,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1184,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1185,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1186,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1187,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1188,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1189,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1190,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1191,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1192,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1193,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1194,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1195,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1196,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1197,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1198,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1199,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1200,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1201,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1202,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1203,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1204,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1205,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1206,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1207,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1208,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1209,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1210,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1211,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1212,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1213,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1214,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1215,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1216,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1217,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1218,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1219,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1220,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1221,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1222,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1223,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1224,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1225,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1226,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1227,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1228,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1229,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1230,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1231,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1232,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1233,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1234,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1235,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1236,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1237,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1238,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1239,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1240,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1241,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1242,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1243,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1244,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1245,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1246,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1247,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1248,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1249,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1250,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1251,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1252,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1253,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1254,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1255,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1256,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1257,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1258,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1259,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1260,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1261,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1262,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1263,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1264,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1265,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1266,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1267,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1268,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1269,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1270,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1271,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1272,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1273,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1274,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1275,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1276,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1277,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1278,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1279,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1280,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1281,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1282,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1283,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1284,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1285,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1286,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1287,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1288,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1289,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1290,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1291,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1292,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1293,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1294,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1295,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1296,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1297,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1298,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1299,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1300,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1301,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1302,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1303,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1304,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1305,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1306,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1307,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1308,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1309,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1310,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1311,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1312,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1313,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1314,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1315,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1316,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1317,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1318,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1319,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1320,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1321,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1322,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1323,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1324,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1325,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1326,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1327,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1328,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1329,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1330,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1331,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1332,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1333,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1334,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1335,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1336,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1337,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1338,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1339,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1340,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1341,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1342,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1343,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1344,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1345,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1346,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1347,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1348,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1349,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1350,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1351,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1352,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1353,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1354,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1355,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1356,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1357,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1358,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1359,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1360,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1361,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1362,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1363,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1364,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1365,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1366,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1367,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1368,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1369,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1370,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1371,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1372,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1373,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1374,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1375,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1376,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1377,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1378,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1379,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1380,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1381,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1382,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1383,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1384,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1385,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1386,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1387,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1388,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1389,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1390,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1391,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1392,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1393,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1394,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1395,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1396,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1397,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1398,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1399,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1400,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1401,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1402,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1403,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1404,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1405,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1406,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1407,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1408,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1409,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1410,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1411,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1412,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1413,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1414,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1415,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1416,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1417,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1418,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1419,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1420,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1421,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1422,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1423,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1424,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1425,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1426,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1427,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1428,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1429,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1430,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1431,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1432,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1433,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1434,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1435,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1436,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1437,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1438,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1439,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1440,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1441,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1442,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1443,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1444,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1445,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1446,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1447,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1448,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1449,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1450,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1451,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1452,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1453,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1454,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1455,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1456,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1457,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1458,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1459,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1460,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1461,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1462,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1463,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1464,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1465,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1466,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1467,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1468,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1469,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1470,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1471,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1472,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1473,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1474,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1475,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1476,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1477,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1478,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1479,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1480,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1481,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1482,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1483,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1484,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1485,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1486,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1487,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1488,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1489,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1490,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1491,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1492,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1493,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1494,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1495,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1496,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1497,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1498,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1499,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1500,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1501,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1502,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1503,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1504,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1505,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1506,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1507,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1508,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1509,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1510,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1511,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1512,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1513,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1514,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1515,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1516,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1517,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1518,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1519,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1520,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1521,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1522,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1523,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1524,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1525,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1526,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1527,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1528,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1529,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1530,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1531,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1532,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1533,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1534,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1535,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1536,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1537,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1538,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1539,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1540,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1541,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1542,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1543,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1544,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1545,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1546,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1547,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1548,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1549,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1550,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1551,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1552,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1553,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1554,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1555,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1556,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1557,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1558,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1559,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1560,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1561,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1562,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1563,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1564,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1565,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1566,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1567,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1568,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1569,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1570,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1571,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1572,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1573,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1574,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1575,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1576,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1577,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1578,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1579,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1580,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1581,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1582,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1583,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1584,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1585,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1586,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1587,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1588,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1589,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1590,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1591,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1592,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1593,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1594,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1595,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1596,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1597,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1598,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1599,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1600,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1601,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1602,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1603,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1604,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1605,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1606,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1607,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1608,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1609,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1610,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1611,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1612,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1613,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1614,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1615,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1616,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1617,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1618,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1619,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1620,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1621,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1622,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1623,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1624,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1625,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1626,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1627,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1628,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1629,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1630,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1631,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1632,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1633,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1634,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1635,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1636,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1637,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1638,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1639,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
1640,"Superlatives fail me. I went with a friend celebrating his visit from New York and as a 'goodbye to Berkeley' where I'd lived for two years, and a 'hello to being 31' which is just horrifying...Anyway: I went on a Monday when they are a bit cheaper, and the meal was one of the best in my lifetime. The appetizer was calamari, the main was lamb, and the desert was a strudel-esque thing with nectarines. This description is wildly inadequate, mind, but I'm not here to write a novel. Suffice to say: every bite was intriguing."
1641,"Mind blowing to read some of these reviews complaining about price or try to rate the location, or no refund policy.  This place is an ""institution"" and part of the history of Bay Area.  Just google Alice Waters or ask your server about it.  This is a place of celebrating an occasion where you can dress up and let your hair down,  A festival of food, with attentive service yet an unassuming ambience that you can only expect in Berkeley.  NOTE:  Monday nights Prix Fix is 75 dollars vs. 100 weekdays and 125 for Weekends.  If you have dietary restriction let them know at least 48 hours. Picky eaters, weight sensitive individuals:  Relax and carry on"
1642,"$125 for ONE meal + 17% service charge is just CRAZY. I realize Chez Panisse conduct sustainable farm-to-table cooking, serve organic seasonal produce, and scount only local manufacturers to do their earthenware. But this was just too expensive - it brought a total of ~$160 per person. Oh, how many good meals I could have with that money.. Well anyway, money was spent, here's my review. Our menu consisted of -mini croutons topped with creme fraiche and black truffle oil-corn soup with lobster, roasted red peppers, and basil-roasted quail and liver, mashed potatoes, and root vegetables-lemon cream puffs with berries dressing Cooking wise, fresh but really wasn't mindblowing.. Come on, it's SF; you can easily find better cooking elsewhere. Ugh I can't be sure if that was money-bias talking but the price did skew (and ruin) my opinion of this place.. sorry. They inform you of the pricing in the prix fixe menu itself so if you change your mind, RUN NOW. But if you're willing to spend, maybe look for another review because I can't be totally objective about the food here. Chez Panisse does give attentive service and provide a lovely ambience though. They only serve each course up when all the people in your party are present. So if one of you is in the bathroom, they'll wait. Oh, and if you pair your meal with wine, there is an additional charge of i think $70. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Dim lighting and a candle by your table set a romantic scene. And the most interesting thing to me was the open kitchen. You can also take a little self-guided tour as you walk yourself to the restroom. It was a little unsatisfying to see how prepared everything was; nothing like Hell''s Kitchen LOL. But I guess they serve a prix fixe menu so that makes sense. Overall, once was enough for the experience. And if you asked me, I would have just gone to Cheeseboard on the other side and ate my heart out. And at the end of the meal, i'll go home knowing i don't regret what I paid for my food."
1643,"During our last trip to Berkeley, my wife and I had dinner at Chez Panisse. We had finally planned in advance and made dinner reservation for upstairs in the main restaurant (versus the downstairs -formal- café, which is quite nice in its own right). We had arrived a few minutes early, had checked in and then ordered a drink downstairs while our table was being readied. The host came down to take our drinks and showed us to our table exactly on time.As we entered the restaurant, we could not help but notice an abundance of dark, rich wood (walls and furniture). A classic, old-school, sophisticated French look and feel vibe. We were seated at a great table, close enough to the ""intended kitchen views"" to see first-hand some of the magic happening. Wait staff was plentiful with very personalized, attentive service. Our server started us with a white wine aperitif. While this is not something I would normally order, it was perfect for the setting and the pre-determined meal we were about to enjoy. The feast we devoured evolved via a number of courses as described below:1) Gold Beet Carpaccio - with ginger, Meyer lemon, fried capers and radish sprouts 2) Lulu's Bourride - with Mendocino Rockfish, wild fennel and aioli crouton 3) Wolfe Ranch Quail (grilled) - with cumin, sweet corn polenta,  yellow Romano beans and summer chanterelles 4) Artisan Cheese Assortment5) Nectarine Galetted - with raspberries and ras al hanout ice cream6) Expresso The food was absolutely marvelous. Beautiful presentation backed up by helpful wait staff.  I should note that I primarily enjoy California wines and know very little about French offerings. I explained this to our waiter and was given a recommendation for a bottle. I was not only impressed with how nice the wine turned-out, but the fact that I was shown one of the more moderately priced options - this was not necessary, under the circumstances. but in retrospect, greatly appreciated. I will return for another meal. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for.... superior spot for a special occasion."
1644,"Happy to have finally made it to Chez PanisseThe reservation and overall booking process was super easy.  Within 1 month you can make a reservation online for either the cafe or the restaurant downstairs - assuming there are openings at the restaurant!  $50 pp deposit with no refund.The menu gets released the week before the reservation.  If you have a dietary restriction as we did (shellfish, pork), you simply let them know when you arrive and they have veggie options for you on those courses. *we were worried before booking about what our options would be since it's pre fixe*The overall food and experience was really special.  You can tell a lot of thought goes into the creation of these dishes and the execution.  I can tell you all the crazy good food we ate... but because it's a daily rotating menu it won't really give you an idea of what you might experience.I'm happy we went - but not sure my bank account can afford coming again soon :-p"
1645,"Chez Panisse is a beautiful craftsman house in the middle of downtown. The entry is decorated with French posters. The warmly lit dining room is buzzing with activity, but it is not too loud because it is broken up into three small subsections and has surfaces to absorb sound. (It is also not very large - there are about 50 seats and only two seatings.) The craftsman light fixtures and the tinted purple windows make for beautiful lighting. The copper surfaces and bowls of flowers are a delight for the eyes.We were warmly welcomed and seated immediately. The service is exquisite - everyone is knowledgeable about the food and eager to answer questions. This includes the kitchen, which is open for your viewing pleasure. The space is a hive of activity, but each person was happy to answer questions.The fixed menu is $125 per person on the weekends. First we had an apertivo of prosecco flavored with a Seville orange reduction. The crisp and dry wine had a little sweet tart flavor that helped wake up our palettes. The amuse bouche was fresh baby radishes were served with pan di mie toast topped with halibut tartar finished with a little chili powder. The creamy fish and the slightly salty bread were both a textural and flavor delight.The crunchy, homemade sourdough baguettes were next delivered with some butter from Strauss Creamery. While enjoying the wonderfully sour baguette and sweet and creamy butter, we decided to split a wine pairing ($65), which I highly recommend unless you are a heavy drinker. Including the apertivo, a wine pairing is probably just shy of a bottle of wine.Our first course was an Andante Dairy goat cheese soufflé with an asparagus, chervil and golden beet salad. There was both raw chervil on the plate as well as a chervil pesto tossed with the roasted golden beets, so the herb was at once peppery and fruity. The olive oil was incredibly fruity, the grassy asparagus was crisp tender, and the beets were al dente. The gorgeous soufflé was soft and creamy with a crisp top crust. The salty and tangy cheese with the grassy note, the mild beets and the sweet oil were a delight. It paired wonderfully with a French 2015 Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc that had distinct honeysuckle and grapefruit flavors.Our second course was a Petite bouillabaisse with bits of Dungeness crab and smoked black cod that was in a tomato tinted broth and finished with a dollop of paprika aioli. The sweet and smoky fishes were fresh, moist and tender. The fennel frond garnish added a nice anise flavor to the deeply flavored but still light and sweet broth. The paprika aioli added a little richness and a welcome warming spice. This was paired with a fuller bodied white wine - a 2015 Bandol Uni-Claret Blend from Alice Water's favorite region in France - Provence. The crisp green apple wine stood up to the tomato flavors without overwhelming the fish.The servers pick the wines based upon what the chefs have put on the menu. They did well and are not always as French focused as they were today. It was also interesting to learn that the 73 year old Alice Waters still approves every menu produced by the restaurant chefs that split the restaurant.For our entrée, we had sliced Sonoma County duck breast grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with a sage and candied orange peel pesto alongside sautéed spinach with roasted watermelon radishes and sunchokes and deep fried spring onions. The tender duck breast with a little crisp fat cap was perfectly seasoned. Its rich meat complimented the crisp and sweet onions. The bitter greens were tempered by the peppery radishes and nutty sunchokes that had developed their sugars when being roasted. The woodsy sage was brightened by the sweet and tangy orange peel. The dish was a symphony of flavors that paired wonderfully with the 2012 Saint Joseph Offenus. The earthy wine was deep and complex but had fruity flavors that paired well with the rich, salty and sweet dish.Our final wine was a La Magendia Saurtenes, which was incredibly fruity on the nose with melon and pear flavors that was on the heavy side but had just the right amount of sweet. It paired perfectly with the tangy apricot reduction that was the based for Lindsey's Almond Cake. The cake was topped with an apricot spread and sliced almonds and was served alongside a cloud of whipped cream with a scoop of homemade wildflower honey ice cream. Sliced tangerines and candied kumquats as well as macerated huckleberries finished the dish. I loved the floral ice cream with the sweet-tart fruits and the rich nutty cake. The dessert was not only beautiful but was delicious.We ended with freshly brewed spearmint tea that cleared the palette. And then a decaf cappuccino with a leaf decorated steamed milk that topped off a rich and not at all bitter brew. It perfect for the dark chocolate caramel truffle and the pan forte, a traditional French candy made with almonds, warm spices and candied orange peel.Perfection."
1646,"Dining at Chez Panisse has been on my list of Bay area to-dos for a while since it is the birthplace of Californian cuisine. I placed a reservation 30 days in advance, which is not as difficult as you would think to get. Then I let the cards fall as they may and hoped with eager anticipation that my pre-set menu would be good! Overall, I absolutely loved the first two dishes. The first was blood oranges with fennel and local halibut and olives. It was so delicious - light, refreshing, crunchy, citrusy, and the halibut added a warm savoriness to the otherwise cold dish. I would have loved more of this. (5/5)Second dish was my favorite -- the quail! How often do I get to eat quail? This was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy. The leeks and asparagus that came alongside were so delicious as well. Plating was on point. (5/5)Dessert was good but not my favorite as I HAVE a sweet tooth but in moderation. I loved the plating - beautifully presented but I think it was too sweet. The ice cream wasn't very sweet though so I suppose you should eat it together but the chocolate torte just overpowered it. Did enjoy the rum caramel sauce though!Service - for a $$$$ restaurant, I didn't really enjoy the service that much. Pacing between the first and second course was oh-so-slow. It seemed like when they served my dishes it was reciting from a textbook. It wasn't careless per se just lacked personality. Also, you feel like you're eating in a Frank Lloyd Wright prairie style building but it's not built by him. Tips:Mondays are their cheapest nights though it's only 3 courses. You do get a nice glass of prosecco (I so wanted another one of these!), an amuse-bouche, and a hot glass of steaming tea (not that impressive), and some pate de fruits that are not stated in the menu."
1647,"I took the Alice Waters and Michael Pollen journalism class on the creation of the slow-food movement at Berkeley and had always been dying to try Chez Panisse. When I was a poor student, I could never get a reservation in time when my parents made surprise visits and I definitely couldn't afford the $75 pre-fix Monday night menu by myself. I finally found employment and made my poor students dreams a reality. The four-year wait was well worth it!  [Food]I didn't know this when I booked, but Monday nights at Chez Panisse feature the cheaper $75 3-course menu. The menu on 3/27/2017 started off with an blood orange, fennel, and local halibut salad. I really like the creativity of the dish as I don't normally enjoy or seek out salad. The main course consisted of a quail dish with leeks, asparagus, onion, and an AMAZING romesco red sauce. Quail isn't normally a common dish that you just eat everyday, but the meat was tender and juicy and the sauce really tied the spring vegetables and the tender meat together. The Chocolate torte with cinnamon ice cream was probably my favorite dish. I have a huge sweet tooth and passionate love for ice cream. Everything about the dish, from the plating, the subtle cinnamon tang of the ice cream, and the gentle chocolate of the torte really ended the meal well. I was also two glasses of sauvignon blanc in so that might have been a contributing factor. [Drinks]I had the half bottle of Mary Edwards wine. The chef provided a sweet prosecco along with a small cracker bite at the beginning of the meal. The prosecco was too sweet for my liking, but Chez Panisse maintains an extensive French wine list. [Décor]The outside of the restaurant resembles a wooden cottage, with a very homy and low lighting inside the restaurant. It was very intimate with more of an older demographic, but I personally loved the wooden setting and décor. [Service]Our waiter was great. The timing between the salad and the quail could have been shorter, but I had no complaints. We had timely refills on bread and water, and our waiter was very personable. Overall, I would highly recommend planning ahead and snagging a reservation for Monday night. At $75 for the pre-fix, I feel the meal was highly worth it. There is a big different between $75 and $125, so I feel the lower price tag definitely made me feel more content about the money I had spent in relation to the quality, amount of food, and time spent enjoying the meal. Go bears."
1648,"I've had many wonderful meals here, and last night was no exception.  It was very good, but considering the price, was not 5 star.  Service was 5 star though- excellent service.The starter was wild king salmon with artichokes, leeks, fennel, and basil mayonnaise.  It was so delicious.  The basil mayonnaise was so flavorful.Next, we had wild fennel risotto with tomales bay clams (only 3 of them, tiny- could have used a couple more, to be honest) sweet peas, and crispy prosciutto.  It was delicious.  Flavors were lovely.Finally, the main, grilled Stemple Creek Ranch grass-fed beef loin au poivre with potato and celery root puree, fried spring onions, and savoy spinach.  I was worried there might be too much pepper- but not the case at all!  Unlike many versions of steak au poivre- this was mildly peppery, and absolutely, tenderly, delicious.  BEST BEEF EVER!  Also, the celery root addition to the potatoes was quite tasty!  And the spicy greens that tasted of horseradish was fun, too.Desert was simple- two slices of Neopolitan ice cream with strawberries and a cookie.  It was good, but not really up to the meal, imo.  I didn't care- was so full by the time dessert came I wouldn't have cared what it was, but it was something I would expect upstairs, not at the end of a 125 dollar dinner (or 700+ for all 4 of us, with the included 17% service, 9 percent tax, and drink and corkage fees).  That's a lot of money- so to end with ice cream and a few strawberries?  well...Extras included proseco with basil and some sweet syrup- I didn't catch what the server said, an amuse bouche- that was on a cracker (I didn't eat that) and some radishes, and some nuts and tiny cookies at the meal's end- as well as some mint tea- just mint steeped in hot water, I think- but it was a nice palate cleanser.  Bread is from Acme (I think) and was very good (love the Acme bags used as trash liners in the bathrooms! ) I ate a lot of bread.  Very good.  Butter also delicious.Considering the investment this dinner is, I think I'll just eat upstairs from now on.  If this went wrong, considering how much it costs, it would be very sad.  Upstairs the food is just as good, but I can have exactly what I want, and I'm not as invested.My husband insisted I add that he thought the 35 dollar corkage was outrageous. We wanted to bring our own wine for sentimental reasons."
1649,"Had a lovely birthday celebration in their restaurant!Had no problems making a Saturday dinner reservation by calling exactly one month in advance. For $125/person (not including 17% service charge or 9% tax), we had:- An aperitivo of prosecco with a splash of vermouth, along with squab liver toast with black truffle. The prosecco was very interesting. I do wish the black truffle came out a little stronger in the squab liver, but the liver itself was very good.- Roasted chanterelle mushroom crostino with fennel salad, prosciutto, and fried sage leaves. Strongest part of this entree was the fennel salad, which was crisp and refreshing. The fried sage leaves were also a nice and unique touch.- Hand-cut saffron and spinach pasta with Dungeness crab, sweet pea shoots, and creme fraiche. One of my favorites of the evening with the pasta itself being delectable. Wish there was more crab though.- Wolfe Ranch quail grilled thyme and green garlic; with kabocha squash puree, curly kale, and fig mostardata. Alone the quail didn't blow me away, but it tasted amazing with the fig, and the lightness of the squash and kale balanced out the heaviness of the quail nicely.- Niloufer's cardamom cake with blood orange sorbetto and tangerines: the cake was perfectly spiced without being overpowering, and the tartness of the sorbetto and tangeries was a nice counterpart.- Chocolate almond and jelly. A nice final touch.Also had their Chez Panisse zinfandel, which was a perfectly nice, drinkable wine. Unfortunately their muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise by Domaine Durban was way too sweet and tasted like alcoholic syrup. Ah well, can't win them all.Overall, I would say service, ambience, and quality of food are excellent, though I do think, for this particular menu, it was overpriced. That said, you do walk (roll?) out feeling very full and satisfied. I would say for fans of Alice Waters, or for those curious about the famed Chez Panisse, it is worth visiting at least once."
1650,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a major accomplishment than at Chez Panisse.Food: Though Alice wasn't present, my roommate and I were fortunate enough to indulge in the downstairs dinner tasting menu on a beautiful Wednesday evening. We started the evening with a taste of complimentary champagne which automatically set the tone for the rest of our dinner, reminding us that this dining experience was a special event in itself. Our server presented us with a complimentary appetizer of baked balls with hints of goat cheese, they were slightly salty, but paired well with our champagne. Multiple baskets of warm and crunchy Acme bread was brought to our table, ensuring we had something to nibble on throughout the evening. The Dungeness Crab Salad included fresh and shredded crab, radishes, herbs and coriander creating a light, fragrant and colorful dish. Following our cold dish, we received a warm Asparagus & Morel Mushroom Risotta which was hearty, texturally balanced due to the crunchy and semi-cooked asparagus, yet soft and creamy due to the fresh parmesan. The risotto was tasty, but a little light, so I was excited when the main entree was brought out. The main entree included a soft and grilled Sonoma Duck breast which was seasoned light with earthy sage and black pepper, the meat was complimented by fried onions and sauteed sweet peas. After inhaling the main entree, we received a warm mint tea to cleanse the palette and prepare for dessert. The Buckwheat Crepe was small, yet dense and packing flavor. The house-made Meyer Lemon Ice Cream with Huckleberry Coulis married well with the crepe. Service: Both my roommate and I really felt welcomed at Chez Panisse. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out my roommate received multiple congratulations and well wishes from staff. They went out of their way to recognize her for her accomplishment without it feeling forced or scripted.Ambiance: Worth strapping on some nice shoes and whatever makes you feel as fine as your fine tasting menu. The downstairs space is small, yet cozy and fancy.  Our experience was heightened after we were able to enjoy the wonderful fragrances of fresh ingredients and dishes being composed before our eyes, the talented chefs hard at work and the rustic kitchen decor that took us out of Berkeley and into a traditional country-style kitchen! I highly recommend taking a peek into their open kitchen.Price: A fine dining experience deserves a fine price, however the price point that is set is more than reasonable.Overall: Considering sourcing and quality of ingredients, innovation of dishes, balance of dishes, wonderful service experience and fine ambiance to match, I understand why Chez Panisse is world-renowned and would highly recommend it for any and ever special occasion."
1651,"Yes. It's worth it.  Yes. It's expensive. Yes. You need to make a reservation far ahead of time. (But maybe not as far ahead as you'd think - we went on a Tuesday at 8:15, and I made the reservation only 10 days beforehand. To get a Saturday - I think you may need to know someone). Yes. It's worth it.It's the whole experience really that makes it 5 stars.Set menus are great. And the timing of set menus is key to experience. There are four courses on the Chez Panisse set menu. However when we arrived they served us quince flavored Prosseco with little toast with goat cheese and fig just to get us going - not part of the menu.  Both were quite nice. Prosseco was very smooth and fun. Toast were a great flavor combo.  Before we move through the courses - let's talk about wine. There is an extensive menu with all sorts of choices (in different price ranges) which I'm sure are fantastic. But for those of us that are not sommeliers, they also have a wine pairing menu for each course for $65. Which is not cheap, but was a great value. Not only do they do a good job of choosing different wines that compliment the food, they also give healthy pours to begin and then if we finished our wine before we finished the course it came with they would give us a refill. So, for not having to make a decision and getting to try multiple wines and really getting a decent amount of wines, I think it's a great value. First course was seared sea scallops with shaved fennel and artichoke salad, mint, and olio nuovo. The scallops were amazing. So flavorful and buttery and perfectly tender. The rest of the salad was fine, but the scallops shone. The wine pairing was a gewurztraminer - which normally are too sweat for me - but this one was actually quite dry and one of my favorite wines of the night.Second course was chanterelle mushroom agnolotti in brood with chestnuts and sage. This was my least favorite course. The mushrooms were quite nice, but the pasta didn't impress me. My husband was impressed by the level of al dente they were but I wasn't into it. It also was the most pinner of the courses - a couple more would have been good. The chestnuts were super buttery and amazing. The sage was somehow made crunchy which was super cool. This was paired with a chardonnay that I don't remember where it was from.  Not as good as the first wine, but still good. Third course was grilled lamb loin, leg and pecorino fried chop. All the meat was quite good. It had a real nice chimichurri too.  The grilled meat was very tender and not over cooked. Fried chop was very crispy but also not over cooked and juicy.  The potato puree that came with it was just that. The kale was also just that. This was paired with a French red that I cannot remember where it was from (I'm horrible with French wine). It paired well with the meat - medium body, easy to drink.Final course was creme caramel with clementines and huckleberries.  I'm not a huge desert fan - but I'd say it was good.  It had a crispy almond thing that came with it that I think was my favorite part. Was served with a dessert wine which I unfortunately don't remember what it was.  Food good - certain things stood out. Wine pairing - very well done.Service. It's the little things that really make a difference. Like the part where every time food came out they had multiple people bring it, so it all arrived at the exact same time. And same with clearing dishes. Seamless. And when the wine ran out - there was more. No wait. And the waiter new when to say something, and when to just refill or take a plate. The timing. Just enough time in between courses, but didn't feel like we were waiting. 2 hour dinner, but flew by. The little things. At the price tag - not something to make a habit of, but worth it. :)"
1652,"Chez Panisse is such a classic that its even more impressive when they live up to the hype. Came to the restaurant level for a Saturday night dinner a wonderful time! Our server Megan could not have been nicer and even let us sneak around the kitchen once service was through. And of course, the food was amazing! We started with a yellowtail carpaccio topped with fried meyer lemons and salmon roe, then a grilled beef loin with a sunchoke gratin and finished with a chocolate hazelnut tart. Every dish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. But given the price tag, definitely a special occasion meal!"
1653,"Chez Panisse is one of those iconic places that you have to try at least once but I'm good with just once. The ingredients are fresh, but the dishes end up tasting a bit boring. Roasted cauliflower and beet salad with chickpea purée and cumin flatbread - ""Chickpea purée"" = hummus. Save some of your bread because the hummus is super good with it. This salad is more beet than cauliflower, but that was a good thing for me. I love yellow and red beets!Hand-cut saffron fettuccine with clams, parsley white wine, and olio nuovo - Strong clam taste throughout and lots of oil. The saffron was more color than taste. The fettuccine does have that slightly rough texture due to being hand-cut versus shaped/flattened through a pasta maker.Pan-roasted Monterey Bay rockfish with celery root, shaved fennel, Meyer lemon, and ginger - Very fishy! The flavor was really light. My favorite part was actually the fennel because it was pickled.Almond cake with red wine Bosc pears, huckleberries, and crème Chantilly - This as good but not amazing. I like how the pears still retained some of the wine flavor, but not too much to be bitter. I could eat a bucket of the crème.Everything seemed like it needed a little umph. My favorite item was the side of anchovies. I wish I got the pizza so I could put the anchovies on there!"
1654,"Alice Waters did start a food revolution. So much so that there is food that is as good (and some better) than at Chez Panisse in the Bay Area. Especially here in the East Bay one can experience amazing food.The thing that sets Chez Panisse apart is a combination of factors: yes, good food is a given. When they serve something great (something you like- check the changing menu), its a great start. The bar is set exceptionally high so that when you are served merely ""good"" food, one can be disappointed. But you're not. Because the service here, from the time you are greeted at the door, to going over the (prix fixe) menu, wine options, to everything, is KIND. Is this what we've come to? In the Bay Area, a hot restaurant usually comes with the bad attitude as well.Chez Panisse is down- to- earth and welcoming. The experience is the restaurant; it's holistic. Yes, you are going for the food but you want ""this""."
1655,"*I love the fact that they advocate food sustainability. They make purchases from local farms/ranches/fisheries/orchards.* They automatically place a 17% service charge, so be mindful to take that to account if you'd like when you're deciding how much to tip.* Make sure to book a reservation!Here's a list of what we ordered and what I think of some of them(*):~Appetizers:: Artichoke, potato, and sunchoke salad with egg and bagna caude vinaigrette  * Baked andante dairy goat cheese with garden lettuce -- absolute recommend this one! The consistency of the chèvre is remarkable: pretty crunchy and smooth; just perfect.~ Main entrée:: Northern halibut with Belgian endive, marinated beets, and salsa di dragoncello: Grilled Sonoma County duck sausages and confit with lentils, braised red cabbage, and salsa verde~Desserts:* Bittersweet chocolate tartlet with almond praline -- I love this one. Definitely a sweet meal ender. Not too sweet. The texture of the tart was to die for. Smooth and crunchy, everything in the plate were there for a reason. : Coconut and passionfruit ice cream with langue de chat~ Drinks:* Chez Panisse Zinfandel (2014) -- Superb! Crisp and robust bold tasteAbsolutely an excellent dining experience. I attest to the exquisiteness of the foods and wines served, as well as the total quality of this café. I'm an undergrad in Berkeley, so my friends and I came in here for a pre-thanksgiving lunch. Because the tables upstairs were not too far apart (but not too close either) with other guests, we instantly connected with the guests in the other tables--turns out they were all Berkeley alumni and that just reinforced the dining experience to say the least! Attentive servers. Cozy interiors too."
1656,"This was my third time at Chez Panisse, and it was a similar experience as before. Solid meal, nice ambiance (especially the gorgeous kitchen which is always outfitted with seasonal ingredients toward the dining room), and good service - but not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. They're not experimenting with food or making anything too crazy here, so it's a safe place to take someone who's a picky eater. They were accommodating to one member of our party with an aversion to pork (they made her a white truffle souffle).Our party of six was seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time of 8:30 p.m. Service was a little off in the beginning as it took what seemed like a while for our waiter to come. Squab pate was standard. 3/5Lobster salad with raddichio and beets was quite nice - a little bitter but mostly sweet and refreshing, when you'd get a bite of parsley. 5/5Cauliflower tri colore soup was a feast for the eyes and mouth, great curry flavor and richness from the creme fraiche on top. 5/5Spit roasted ham was tender but a little raw for some of us, with crispy potatoes and a sweet mostarda di frutta. The presentation was a bit lacking, as it was not quite as dainty and beautiful as the others. 3/5Lemon spearmint tea served before dessert was lovely. The waiter came by to refill, since the dessert was taking a while to come out, but he did not hear me when I said I wanted a refill. Chocolate hazelnut espresso meringata was very one note for me. I wish it had come with a gelato or something, because it was not very fulfilling as a dessert. 2/5"
1657,"Holy smokes.This restaurant is possibly the most lavish, delicious, and best dining experience I have ever had! The staff is amazing and answered all of my questions while the food practically spoke for itself in flavor and unique design!Now I know this is pricey, so this is a very very very special occasion restaurant, but I do think the quality and crafting of what you get is worth the price! They also will work with you for the special occasion (they put happy anniversary on our desert for our occasion)! I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite plate from the pre-determined menu as they all stole the show! Everything was well balanced and so so fresh. Thank you for making our evening so magical!"
1658,"First dinner in the restaurant and was not disappointed. I've written a review for the Cafe so I won't bore you with the history and lore again surrounding the founder/owner. The restaurant is a fixed menu and fresh daily.  Always fresh and in season, sustainable and beautifully presented. The food is the main attraction, as it should be. The atmosphere complete with rose light and California Arts and Craftsmen decor is understated so that the focus is on cuisine. It's a place you need to experience at least once. Dare I say it? Yes, it's a bucket list restaurant. Make the reservation, spend the money, you will thank me later."
1659,"Chez Panisse had long been on my to-do list so I finally went last night with my wife. I really didn't know what to expect other than  a hefty price tag and the fresh ingredients that Chez Panisse was known for. Turns out that I was completely blown away by the entire experience. The black cod and Belgian endive salad is something I could eat everyday. It was great! The main course was the Paine Farm squab with fennel and coriander. This was by-far the best poultry I've ever tasted. The flavor was incredible and the meat was moist.With a restaurant of this caliber one would expect an equivalent level service to match. Chez Panisse passed with flying colors in that regard. The only negative I would say is the price tag. Our meal for two came out to around $320 when you include the 17% service charge and taxes, and we didn't even order any wine. Despite this, my wife and I agreed that we would go to Chez Panisse again for special occasions. We had a great time."
